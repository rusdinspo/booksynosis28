<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Sovereignty</h2><p><p>The acceptance of human rights and minority rights, the increasing role of international financial institutions, and globalization have led many observers to question the continued viability of the sovereign state. Here a leading expert challenges this conclusion. Stephen Krasner contends that states have never been as sovereign as some have supposed. Throughout history, rulers have been motivated by a desire to stay in power, not by some abstract adherence to international principles. Organized hypocrisy--the presence of longstanding norms that are frequently violated--has been an enduring attribute of international relations.</p><br><p> Political leaders have usually but not always honored international legal sovereignty, the principle that international recognition should be accorded only to juridically independent sovereign states, while treating Westphalian sovereignty, the principle that states have the right to exclude external authority from their own territory, in a much more provisional way. In some instances violations of the principles of sovereignty have been coercive, as in the imposition of minority rights on newly created states after the First World War or the successor states of Yugoslavia after 1990; at other times cooperative, as in the European Human Rights regime or conditionality agreements with the International Monetary Fund.</p><br><p> The author looks at various issues areas to make his argument: minority rights, human rights, sovereign lending, and state creation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Differences in national power and interests, he concludes, not international norms, continue to be the most powerful explanation for the behavior of states.</p></p><p><br> <p>"Stephen Krasner weighs in on a growing debate over the continued relevance of sovereignty today. Is it declining or not? Is the state system about to be replaced by something else? Krasner's book will spark much debate and become required reading for all those who wish to think seriously about the nature of sovereignty today."<b>--Hendrik Spruyt, Columbia University</b><br> </p> <br> <p>"<i>Sovereignty: Organized Hypocrisy</i> is a book with a provocative theme that is tracked through a variety of interesting cases to a conclusion that may help to clarify contemporary discussions of a central theoretical and practical issue in the discipline. It is likely to become a standard example of mainstream realist efforts to address the current generation of arguments that globalization is producing fundamental change in international relations."<b>--Jack Donnelly, University of Denver</b><br> </p> <br><b>Stephen D.

There are biographical profiles on military leaders (Napoleon, Caesar, Eisenhower), theorists (von Clausewitz, Sun Tzu), and inventors (Fulton), among other notable figures. The contributors also discuss weapons and equipment; wars, campaigns, and battles; strategy and tactics; espionage and propaganda; logistics and fortifications; and military life, literature, and medicine. In addition, the book includes many wide-ranging contextual entries on topics as diverse as animals in war, pacifism, and venereal disease. The <em>Companion</em> boasts 75 specially commissioned maps, 20 in-text line diagrams, extensive cross-referencing, and guides to further reading.<br> With superb coverage of land warfare in Europe and North America, plus numerous entries on war in the air and at sea around the world and throughout history, <em>The Oxford Companion to Military History</em> is the most wide-ranging and authoritative reference on all aspects of military history currently available.</p><p><br><strong>Richard Holmes</strong> is Professor of Military and Security Studies at Cranfield University and the Royal Military College of Science.

He has presented two popular BBC Television series on military history and authored six monographs on the subject. <p> Although this reference work surveys all military services from ancient to modern time periods, it emphasizes land warfare in Europe and North America from the eighteenth through the twentieth centuries. It contains approximately 1,300 entries arranged in an A-Z format written by some 148 contributors from Great Britain, Europe, and North America. There are 31 feature articles of two or more pages on topics such as <i>Artillery</i>, <i>Infantry</i>, <i>Logistics</i>, <i>Peacekeeping</i>, <i>Tactics</i>, and <i>Women in the military</i>. Appropriately placed throughout the text are 70 black-and-white maps and 15 black-and-white illustrations. Entries are cross-referenced and signed, and many contain a short bibliography of one to five items at the end. </p><p>There are numerous single-volume reference tools with coverage similar to that of <i>The Oxford Companion to Military History</i>. One recent example is Cowley's <i>Readers Companion to Military History</i> (Houghton Mifflin, 1996), which has more than 600 entries, 40 maps, and 89 black-and-white illustrations. All entries are signed, and most have short bibliographies. Holmes compares favorably with Cowley, with more entries and maps but fewer illustrations. <i>The Oxford Companion to Military History</i> should be considered by high-school, public, and academic libraries that need a convenient military history guide. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Candide, his masterpiece, is a brilliant satire of the theory that our world is &#34;the best of all possible worlds.&#34; The book traces the picaresque adventures of the guileless Candide, who is forced into the army, flogged, shipwrecked, betrayed, robbed, separated from his beloved Cunegonde, tortured by the Inquisition, et cetera, all without losing his resilience and will to live and pursue a happy life.</p><p>4 1-hour cassettesVoltaire (Francois-Marie Arouet) (1694--1778) was one of the key thinkers of the European Enlightenment.

Rodgers and three colleagues climbed into an unarmored Humvee loaded with satellite transmission equipment and fell into column formation with the MIAI Abrams battle tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles of Apache Troop, Third Squadron, of the storied 7th Cavalry and crossed the Line of Departure between Kuwait and Iraq. <i>Sleeping with Custer and the 7th Cavalry: An Embedded Reporter in Iraq </i>is Rodgers&#x2019;s account of the fight from the Kuwaiti border to the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.</p><p>Rodgers was embedded with the tip of the tip of the spear,&#x201d;&nbsp;the armored reconnaissance unit tasked with clearing the way for the invasion of Iraq. For the next three weeks Rodgers a seasoned combat correspondent who has covered armed conflicts in the West Bank, along the Green Line&#x201d;&nbsp;in Lebanon, and in Sarajevo, Azerbaijan, and Afghanistan was a first-person witness to the opening campaign of the most significant war America has embarked upon since Vietnam.</p><p>Rodgers and his journalistic colleagues in Operation Iraqi Freedom became pioneers in the process of embedding, the placing of journalists who can transmit video reports in real time under combat conditions with no censoring authority to block their reporting. During this journey into war, Rodgers and his crew embraced the dangers, the numbing fatigue, and the moments of stark fear of the young armored cavalrymen they lived with twenty-four hours each day, an experience that created for them the lifelong bond that only soldiers serving together under fire share.</p><p>Rodgers also details his return visit to Iraq a year later, reflecting on the nature of war and sharing his personal feelings about a conflict that has claimed the lives of over fifteen hundred American men and women. The volume is illustrated with photographs taken during the invasion by Jeff Barwise, the CNN engineer who accompanied Rodgers.</p></p><p><p><b>Walter C. Rodgers,</b> a<b> </b>senior international correspondent for CNN, has more than thirty years of experience as a broadcast journalist. A former ABC News bureau chief in Moscow and a former CNN bureau chief in Jerusalem, he has covered many major events in the Middle East such as suicide bombings in Israel, the assassination of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and Middle East summit conferences.</p>Rodgers, a CNN correspondent, was embedded for three weeks in March 2003 with the Seventh Calvary, who advanced from the Kuwaiti border to Baghdad. In this fascinating account, he begins with his experiences at Embed U, the orientation school for journalists at which he was taught how to deal with chemical weapons, which were never used by the Iraqis. He recalls going into war zones in a refitted Humvee purchased from King Hummer, a used-car salesman in Kuwait. Rodgers and his crew struggled along with the cavalry, trying to stay alive and developing close ties with the soldiers, who never questioned the legitimacy of their missions. The benefit of embedding was the firsthand view of combat it offered the reporters, but Rodgers notes that the embedded journalist necessarily lacks a broader picture. Returning to Iraq a year later, Rodgers interviewed soldiers and Iraqis and found a higher level of danger since the invasion. This stirring close-up account puts a human face on the bravery and determination of all those engaged in the conflict in Iraq. <i>Vanessa Bush</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

What is even more surprising is that the case has remained cold for decades. Combining archival research and investigative journalism, Pulitzer Prize nominated historian James Presley reveals evidence that provides crucial keys to unlocking this decades-old puzzle.</p><p>Dubbed "the Phantom murders" by the press, these grisly crimes took place in an America before dial telephones, DNA science, and criminal profiling. Even pre-television, print and radio media stirred emotions to a fever pitch. <em>The Phantom Killer</em>, exhaustively researched, is the only definitive nonfiction book on the case, and includes details from an unpublished account by a survivor, and rare, never-before-published photographs.</p><p>Although the case lives on today on television, the Internet, a revived fictional movie and even an off-Broadway play, with so much of the investigation shrouded in mystery since 1946, rumors and fractured facts have distorted the reality. Now, for the first time, a careful examination of the archival record, personal interviews, and stubborn fact checking come together to produce new insights and revelations on the old slayings.</p> 16 pages B&amp;W photographs</p><p>?James Presley ?has a Ph.D. in history from the University of Texas and has won numerous awards for his journalism, including the Anson Jones Award and the John H.

Pastors, students, supervisors, and mentors all wish to think theologically about their ministries but often feel inadequately prepared. This book seeks to respond by showcasing a variety of approaches to theological reflection brought to bear upon actual situations in ministry. It is written by theological field educators. We define theological reflection as reflection upon lived, embodied experiences in ministry that seeks to make sense of practice and form reflectors in habits for competent ministry. An introductory chapter defines theological reflection as practiced within field education and points readers toward a diversity of approaches. Eleven subsequent chapters present two reflections upon the same case, each reflection written by a different author and representing a different reflection method. The book&#39;s significance is as a resource for teaching theological reflection in a range of settings. It not only offers a definition of and rationale for theological reflection but models various approaches to it. Its use of cases furthermore models the use of case studies in theological education and pastoral practice more widely.</p><p>Barbara J.

Chubb and Moe argue that these reforms are destined to fail because they do not get to the root of the problem. The fundamental causes of poor academic performance, they claim, are not to be found in the schools, but rather in the institutions of direct democratic control by which the schools have traditionally been governed. Reformers fail to solve the problem-when the institutions ARE the problem. The authors recommend a new system of public education, built around parent-student choice and school competition, that would promote school autonomy&#x2014;thus providing a firm foundation for genuine school improvement and superior student achievement.</p><br><br></p><p>During the 1980s, widespread dissatisfaction with America&#39;s schools gave rise to a powerful movement for educational change, and he nations&#39;s political institutions responded with aggressive reforms.

Within this world exists a group of crime busters, who don elaborate costumes to conceal their identity and fight crime, and an intricate plot to kill and discredit these "superheroes."<br> <br> Alan Moore's Watchmen popularized the graphic novel format, has been named one of Time magazine's top 100 novels, and is now being made into a highly anticipated movie adaptation. This latest book in the popular Blackwell Philosophy and Pop Culture series peers into Moore's deeply philosophical work to parse and deconstruct the ethical issues raised by Watchmen's costumed adventurers, their actions, and their world. From nuclear destruction to utopia, from governmental authority to human morality and social responsibility, it answers questions fans have had for years about Watchmen's ethical quandaries, themes, and characters.</p><p>Can we justify Ozymandias's grand plan? <p>Does Dr. Manhattan really know what's going to happen in the future?</p> <p>Is the Comedian actually a comedian (or just a jerk)?</p> <p>Can either Silk Spectre be considered a feminist?</p> <p>Does Nite Owl's paunch actually make him virtuous?</p> <p>Watchmen is the most critically acclaimed graphic novel ever published and turned the world of comic superheroes on its head.

In this groundbreaking book Evelyn Lincoln examines the formation of the new career of printmaker during the late fifteenth century and throughout the sixteenth century in Italy. She focuses particularly on the practical relationship between the ancient skill of drawing and the more modern techniques of artisans who made prints by engraving images into copper or wood. Looking closely at the widely diverse prints issuing from early Italian presses, Lincoln shows how Italian social, religious, and educational practices are revealed in these printed images, demonstrating how the printmaker&#x2019;s training and experience affected the look of the finished work.<br><br>Lincoln builds her discussion around the work of three printmakers practicing at different times and under varying economic opportunities and restraints: Andrea Mantegna in Mantua, Domenico Beccafumi in Siena, and Diana Mantuana (Diana Scultori) in Rome. She shows how the occupational origins of early printmakers and publishers affected how they thought about the functions of multiple images. This account of their work at powerful courts, in a small republic, and in a cosmopolitan city sets the prints in the context of related paintings, sculpture, and architecture, describing a period when printmaking opened up new ways to make a living and transformed the mechanisms of Renaissance visual culture.<br></p><p><b>Evelyn Lincoln</b> is assistant professor of the history of art and architecture at Brown University.<br>By the early 1500s, woodblock prints, engravings, and the new technique of etching were all used by the expanding publishing world. Though it remained generally a sideline, there was enough patronage and popular interest in printmaking for artists to earn a living. And artists to the north, notably Albrecht D rer, were reaching a wider audience through editions made at their workshops. Lincoln (history of art and architecture, Brown Univ.) gives us a clear indication of the spread of printmaking as a vocation in Italy. She centers on three artists living in different cities: Andrea Mantegna in Mantua, Domenico Beccafumi in Siena, and Diana Mantuana (Diana Scultori) in Rome. Using these examples, Lincoln covers more than geography and stylistic preferences. The reader gains insight into the Italian economy, the court and guild systems, and the life of a female artist during the Renaissance. There is information about the creation of chiaroscuro prints, which allowed artists to receive their training, and anecdotes about Giorgio Vasari. Lincoln is a true scholar, and the book is loaded with interesting material for serious students of printmaking and art history. For this reason, it is best suited for academic collections. However, this is a well-researched book for anyone curious about this period in history.DSusan Lense, Columbus, OH <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Understanding Violence and Victimization (6th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b>For courses in Violence and Victimization, Victimology, and Crime and Violence.</b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <b>Combines theory with applied responses to victimization.</b> </p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> <i>Understanding Violence and Victimization</i>, Sixth Edition, goes beyond simple discussions of violence to explore the social and legal responses to victimization.

Then I could fist-bump the angel sitting on my right shoulder and get on with doing all the things God has called me to do. That would change everything.<br><br>I&#x2019;d discover an unshakable confidence. It wouldn&#x2019;t be borrowed from the ever-changing assessments of others. I would instinctively offer my weaknesses as a platform for God&#x2019;s power instead of typecasting myself as someone God<br>couldn&#x2019;t use due to my endless character flaws.<br><br>I&#x2019;d be unstoppable because the devil wouldn&#x2019;t be able to dominate my mind with the kinds of fears that control me a lot of the time. Then I would be able to move forward in faith without being scared of failure or rejection or the sacrifice required to obey God.<br><br>I&#x2019;d never again be paralyzed by condemnation or bullied by feelings of unworthiness. And at the end of each day I&#x2019;d go to sleep in perfect peace because I&#x2019;d be finishing the day with no shame, no regrets, no need to sew any fig leaves to conceal anything.<br><br>I&#x2019;d be nearly immune from discouragement, because I would stop wondering if the sky was falling every time I faced a new challenge. I&#x2019;d see my biggest obstacles as my greatest opportunities...and all the other stuff you read on Starbucks cups.<br><br>Unfortunately, there&#x2019;s no devil on my shoulder.<br><br>What&#x2019;s worse, there&#x2019;s no angel either.<br><br>Instead, I&#x2019;ve got this ceaseless war going on inside my heart and my head. I&#x2019;m waging it every millisecond of every minute of every hour of every day&#x2014;nights, holidays, and weekends too.<br><br>####<br><br>I wake up every day to the crow of the chatterbox.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s a transcript of my internal dialogue from a recent morning. It&#x2019;s a real-time example of the kind of chatter that can derail my day before it even gets started. Sometimes over the most ridiculous things you can imagine.<br><br>The thoughts are flying so fast now that I can&#x2019;t keep track, much less sort them out and put them where they belong. Thinking about these thoughts at all only seems to feed them. That&#x2019;s why they keep overpowering me, because I keep feeding them. I know this, but it never stops me from doing it. Not this time, not ten years ago, and it won&#x2019;t be any different ten years from now, I&#x2019;m beginning to believe.<br><br>This is so stupid. I&#x2019;m being so stupid.<br><br>It&#x2019;s only a light bulb.<br><br>A burned-out light bulb has turned into a mini-midmorning meltdown in my mind, and I can&#x2019;t find the switch to shut it off. The meltdown, I mean, not the light bulb.<br><br>So I&#x2019;m standing in the shower, and the light bulb is out, and it&#x2019;s like the sky is falling.<br><br>As soon as I stepped into the shower, I noticed, for the third time, that the middle bulb was out over the sink on the other side of the bathroom. Now that I&#x2019;m in the shower, stranded, phoneless, how am I going to put in Evernote that the light bulb is out? With my pathetic attention span, what are the chances I&#x2019;ll remember to replace the light bulb after I get out?<br><br>I definitely don&#x2019;t have time to change the light bulb&#x2014;I&#x2019;m already going to be ten minutes late for this meeting. If there&#x2019;s no traffic. I&#x2019;m always running late for meetings. I&#x2019;m a late person. It&#x2019;s because I hit the snooze button three times every morning, because I&#x2019;m spiritually apathetic. Pastor Mickey used to get up at 5 a.m. and spend two hours with God, and he said, &#x201c;He who runs from God in the morning will scarce find Him throughout the day.&#x201d; They should put that on a Starbucks cup too.<br><br>Either way, God is gone for the day, and it&#x2019;s not even 9 a.m. And now I&#x2019;m running twelve minutes late, and the light bulb is still out.<br><br>I&#x2019;m screwed.<br><br>And who am I kidding? Even if I had time to change the light bulb, yeah, right, like I have a clue where Holly keeps them. Now that&#x2019;s really pathetic. What would people think if they found out about that one: the woman changes all the light bulbs around that house! What kind of example am I setting for my kids?<br><br>Did I even pray with the kids last night? the night before that?<br><br>Dunno. But I did Instagram that sunset shot with the kids at the creek last Friday. So there&#x2019;s that.<br><br>&#x201c;Cock-a-doodle-do.&#x201d; The chatterbox informs me that I&#x2019;m fourteen minutes late...and I suck as a person.<br><br>I&#x2019;m feeding the machine, and it&#x2019;s eating me alive.<br><br>And the chatter will continue to race through my mind until I decide to downshift and put things back in perspective: Calm down, Furtick. It&#x2019;s. Just. A. Light bulb.<br><br>Just like that, if only for a split second, the chatterbox gives way. And I get on with my day. <br><br>Unfortunately, it won&#x2019;t be long until the chatterbox sounds off again. Probably next time about something much more serious than a light bulb. So much doubt, panic, raw impulse, and bogus conjecture stream through my mind. My<br>soul sometimes feels like a Twitter feed where I&#x2019;m following a million of the most annoying people ever, and I can&#x2019;t find the Unfollow button.<br><br>####<br><br>But God is faithful to speak too. His voice rises from the pages of His Word, which is the exact expression of His will. He speaks, not only on Sunday mornings in the sanctuary where the congregation is gathered, but also in the stillness<br>of His works scattered across the night skies. His Spirit speaks with promptings that are not audible&#x2014;often they are much louder than that&#x2014;always in perfect harmony with the Scriptures and always resounding with perfect wisdom.<br><br>And in every season of my life, God has sent reminders to confirm that He has perfectly designed me and totally enabled me for everything He&#x2019;s called me to do. Sometimes He&#x2019;ll do that through a simple picture, song, text, or conversation that rings with affirmation for days.<br><br>Other times, at critical junctures, God has spoken dramatic words of encouragement over my life.<br><br>A few years ago I was on a plane headed home, and I looked out the window during the descent. The sunset seemed to be painting the skyline in neon orange, illuminating the city where I had just moved to start a church. It was a glowing visual that set the scene for God to speak to my heart: This is your city. I&#x2019;ve called you here to pour out your life for My cause. Be confident, because everywhere you set your foot belongs to Me, and you belong to Me, and together we&#x2019;re going to take this city for My glory.<br><br>I&#x2019;m sure my translation of this conversation isn&#x2019;t word perfect, because you know how tricky cross-cultural communication with God can be. Plus, I can&#x2019;t find the notebook where I frantically scribbled every word of those impressions. The part I&#x2019;m sure of is that I heard God encouraging me at a time when I really needed it. We were only a couple of months into getting our new church off the ground. I needed some reassurance, and God delivered.<br><br>And it was His voice piercing through the roar of my doubts that lifted my perspective. It was just enough to keep me moving forward in faith.<br><br>####<br><br>Now I&#x2019;d like to ask you a few questions.<br><br>Is it possible to be the kind of person who can be distracted to the point of utter despair by a blown light bulb and still hear God calling you to do great things as you stare down at your city through a sunset?<br><br>Can God&#x2019;s voice coexist with maniacal chatter&#x2014;within the same person?<br><br>And how can I silence the voice of the enemy when the enemy is in me? Can you relate to this contradiction?<br><br>I used to think that someone who struggled with the kinds of weaknesses I deal with daily was useless to God. I felt so often like I was drowning in internal dialogue I couldn&#x2019;t control. It had been the soundtrack of my life for as long as I could remember. I had hoped these problems would finally be fixed when I became a committed Christian. And I hoped for it again each time I experienced spiritual highs along the way in my journey of faith.<br><br>But the beat went on.<br><br>Yet everything changed when I began to realize God has given us the ability to choose the dialogue we believe and respond to. And once we learn how, we can switch from lies to truth as deliberately as we can choose the Beatles over Miley Cyrus on satellite radio.<br><br>Choosing to believe this, moment by moment, and acting on it is the most important habit you will ever develop. It is the key to pressing ahead and doing God&#x2019;s will anyway, even as you are bombarded with thoughts, feelings, and even facts about why you can&#x2019;t do it. Why you shouldn&#x2019;t do it. And why you&#x2019;ll never be able to do it. Why you&#x2019;re too dysfunctional, too petty, too immature, too melancholy, too impulsive... <br><br>I&#x2019;m now awakening to the reality that we can access the power of God&#x2019;s promises to constantly crash the system of our broken beliefs. I&#x2019;m learning how to overpower the shouts of the Enemy by bending my ear to the whisper of God&#x2019;s supernatural truths about my identity in Him and His strength in me. This isn&#x2019;t something I did once and now it&#x2019;s over or something I can afford to do occasionally when it&#x2019;s convenient. It requires constancy. It&#x2019;s the only way I know to be the father, husband, leader, friend, and believer that God says I already am, the kind of person I am straining to believe I can become. Winning the war of words inside your soul means learning to defy your inner critic. But that&#x2019;s easier said than done. And I think many times, as believers, we sense we are losing this war. But we don&#x2019;t know what to do about it because we don&#x2019;t know where to find the weapons, and we wouldn&#x2019;t know where to aim them if we did.<br><br>In other words, we feel powerless to crash the chatterbox. And now would probably be a good time to explain exactly what I mean by that.</p><h2>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (Macmillan Collector&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p>Designed to appeal to the book lover, the Macmillan Collector's Library is a series of beautifully bound pocket-sized gift editions of much loved classic titles.

At the same time, Charles Moon - a fellow damaged survivor of the war - has been asked to locate the grave of a village ancestor.

What Berkin discovers here will stay with him for the rest of his life . . .</p></p><p>Any good reader has, well, <i>had it</i> with novels of healing. The culture of confession has given rise to novels that begin with an unspeakable act (graphically described) and end in redemption (this part is usually more vague). That's not how it works in J.L. Carr's quiet, brief, dreamy <i>A Month in the Country</i>. Writing in 1978, Carr's narrator, Tom Birkin, recalls the summer of 1920. A veteran of the Great War and a cuckold, Tom arrives in Oxgodby to restore a medieval mural in the church. His single season in this town in the north of England passes quickly: he sleeps in the belfry, makes a friend or two, falls secretly in love with the vicar's wife, and, chipping away at plaster and dirt, uncovers a lost masterpiece. These events seem to melt past Tom in the heat of the perfect, fleeting English summer: "The front gardens of cottages were crammed with marjoram and roses, marguerites, sweet William, at night heavy with the scent of stocks. The Vale was heavy with leaves, motionless in the early morning, black caves of shadow in the midday heat, blurring the sound of trains hammering north and south." <p> Carr devotes many fewer words to Tom's time in the war. The vicar's wife tries to ask him about it. "'What about hell on earth?' she said. I told her I'd seen it and lived there and that, mercifully, they usually left an exit open." His healing consists of not talking about his past--perhaps a revolutionary notion these days. <i>A Month in the Country</i>, with its paean to a lost, good place, oddly recalls Alain-Fournier's <i>Le Grand Meaulnes</i>. But where that novel was elliptical, Carr's work values clarity and simplicity above all. These are rare enough qualities, but to find them in a novel of romance and healing is a rarer pleasure still. <i>--Claire Dederer</i></p>James Lloyd Carr was born in 1912 and attended the village school at Carlton Miniott in Yorkshire.

Transmitted by body lice, it afflicts the dispossessed&#x2015;refugees, soldiers, and ghettoized peoples&#x2015;causing hallucinations, terrible headaches, boiling fever, and often death. The disease plagued the German army on the Eastern Front and left the Reich desperate for a vaccine. For this they turned to the brilliant and eccentric Polish zoologist Rudolf Weigl. <p>In the 1920s, Weigl had created the first typhus vaccine using a method as bold as it was dangerous for its use of living human subjects. The astonishing success of Weigl&#x2019;s techniques attracted the attention and admiration of the world&#x2015;giving him cover during the Nazi&#x2019;s violent occupation of Lviv. His lab soon flourished as a hotbed of resistance. Weigl hired otherwise doomed mathematicians, writers, doctors, and other thinkers, protecting them from atrocity. The team engaged in a sabotage campaign by sending illegal doses of the vaccine into the Polish ghettos while shipping gallons of the weakened serum to the Wehrmacht.</p><p>Among the scientists saved by Weigl, who was a Christian, was a gifted Jewish immunologist named Ludwik Fleck. Condemned to Buchenwald and pressured to re-create the typhus vaccine under the direction of a sadistic Nazi doctor, Erwin Ding-Schuler, Fleck had to make an awful choice between his scientific ideals or the truth of his conscience. In risking his life to carry out a dramatic subterfuge to vaccinate the camp&#x2019;s most endangered prisoners, Fleck performed an act of great heroism.</p><p>Drawing on extensive research and interviews with survivors, Arthur Allen tells the harrowing story of two brave scientists&#x2015;a Christian and a Jew&#x2015; who put their expertise to the best possible use, at the highest personal danger.</p> 35 illlustrations</p><p>Arthur Allen has written for the New York Times Magazine, the Washington Post, The Atlantic, the Associated Press, Science, and Slate. His books include Vaccine: The Controversial Story of Medicine&#x2019;s Greatest Lifesaver. He lives in Washington, where he writes about health for Politico.&#x201c;If there could be no poetry after Auschwitz, could there be any pure science or medicine? In this excellent and disturbing work, Arthur Allen brings to light an extraordinary story of medical research amid horror. Among the fascinating characters in this history, we encounter one of the great founders of the sociology of science, Ludwik Fleck, and the depraved thought collectives he endured, ones that equated lice and disease with a people and their extermination. Unforgettable.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>George Makari, author of <em>Revolution in Mind: The Creation of Psychoanalysis</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The amazing story of Jewish prisoner-scientists in Buchenwald who made a vaccine against one of history&#x2019;s greatest killers: typhus. Their untold secret--they provided the real vaccine to camp inmates but a fake one to German troops at the Eastern Front. Arthur Allen&#x2019;s thriller is a combination of <em>Microbe Hunters</em>, <em>Schindler&#x2019;s List,</em> and <em>The Twilight Zone</em>. I couldn&#x2019;t put it down.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Paul A. Offit, M.D.</strong><br><br>&#x201c;With masterful attention to detail, Arthur Allen has assembled a story of tragedy, courage, and scientific creativity. A fantastic laboratory, and a fantastic book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Nathan Guttman, Washington bureau chief, <em>The Forward</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An outstanding history of the pursuit of a vaccine by persons at great risk from the Nazis, and a human story of science and medicine amid the atrocities of World War II. The science is accurate, but of far greater interest is the history of this period and hopefully the lessons it has for our future.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dr. Walter Orenstein, former director, National Immunization Program, CDC</strong><br><br>&#x201c;A captivating story of ethics during wartime and the perils of working with the enemy.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Allen is unflinching in his retelling of this monstrous era, but he manages to avoid writing a depressing narrative. Instead, Weigl, Fleck and their vaccines illuminate the inherent social complexities of science and truth and reinforce the overriding good of man. An unforgettable book.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews, Starred Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fascinating.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Tilli Tansey, <em>Nature</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Wholly surprising and affecting.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jonathan Kirsch, <em>Jewish Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Painfully thought-provoking ... [Allen] writes without sanctimony and never simplifies the people in his book or the moral issues his story inevitably raises.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Howard Schneider, <em>Wall Street Journal</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Allen&#x2019;s vivid depictions of the scientific community before and during the war and the treacherous parallel paths Weigl and Fleck traversed&#x2015;gleaned in part from interviews with Holocaust survivors&#x2015;are stirring. Considering all the energy channeled into mere survival, Allen&#x2019;s book makes you wonder what pinnacles of research might have been achieved by now, if not for the march of war.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Laura Fischer Kaiser, <em>ScienceNews</em></strong></p><h2>Mr Finchley Goes to Paris (Classic Canning)</h2><p><p><strong>Book 2 of the classic trilogy of humorous adventures</strong></p><p>An ebullient <strong>Mr Finchley</strong> is about to propose marriage to a lady he had rescued from mishap, when he is sent to Paris by his firm.</p><p>There he manages to upset a boat, adopt a stray orphan and get himself kidnapped.

She could notwould notlie to the child. They had never lied to Mindy. She had grown up knowing that she had another set of parents.

The selections from the work of fourteen contemporary philosophers not only display the multiplicity of approaches being pursued since the breakup of any consensus on what philosophy is, but also help to clarify this proliferation of views and to spell out today's basic options for doing, or not doing, philosophy today. With a general introduction delineating what is in dispute between the different parties to the end-of-philosophy debates, brief introductions to the thought of each author, and suggestions for further reading following each selection, <i>After Philosophy</i> is ideally suited for use in any course that includes an overview of the bewildering variety of contemporary approaches to philosophy.</p><p><b>Major Sections and Contributors<br></b>I.

It examines the manner in which the development of bureaucratic and participatory institutions changed the character and capacities of governments throughout German Europe; the economic expansion in which the productivity of both agriculture and manufacturing increased, commercial activity intensified, and urban growth was encouraged; and the rising culture of print, which sustained new developments in literature, philosophy, and scholarship, and helped transform the rules and procedures of everyday life. These developments, it is argued, led to an erosion of the traditional values and institutions, and played an important part in the transformation of German politics, society, and culture. Rather than viewing the development of a Prussian-led Nation State as "natural" or inevitable, the book emphasizes alternative forces of unity and division which existed up until the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.</p><p>This is a uniquely authoritative study of German history between the mid-eighteenth century and the formation of the Bismarckian Reich. This is an extensive account of social and cultural, as well as political developments and shows that the creation of a Prussian-led nation-state should not be seen as &#39;natural&#39; or inevitable.James J.

But the laughter that the play insights has a biting edge to it and the sexual intrigue an unsettling depth. As Anne Russell points out in her introduction to this edition, there are three options for women in the society represented in <em>The Rover</em>: marriage, the convent, or prostitution. In this marriage economy the witty and pragmatic virgin Hellena learns how to survive, while the prostitute Angellica Bianca can retain her autonomy only so long as she remains free from romantic love. It seems that in this world women can only be free by the anonymity of disguise&#x2015;yet the mask is also the mark of the prostitute. And, paradoxically, disguise is the device that in many ways drives the plot towards marriage. </p> <p> Enormously popular through the eighteenth century, <em>The Rover</em> is now once again widely performed. Filled with the play of ideas, it is one of the most amusing, entertaining&#x2015;and unsettling&#x2015;of comedies. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Anne Russell</strong> is Associate Professor of English at Wilfrid Laurier University and a specialist in 17th-century drama. </p><p> &#x201c;This well-conceived edition of Aphra Behn&#x2019;s <em>The Rover</em> begins with a lively, thorough and intelligent introduction to the play.

About half of these areas were occupied or regularly used by indigenous peoples. Millions who had been living sustainably on their land for generations were displaced in the interests of conservation. In <i>Conservation Refugees</i>, Mark Dowie tells this story. This is a &#x201c;good guy vs. good guy&#x201d; story, Dowie writes; the indigenous peoples' movement and conservation organizations have a vital common goal&#x2015;to protect biological diversity&#x2015;and could work effectively and powerfully together to protect the planet and preserve biological diversity. Yet for more than a hundred years, these two forces have been at odds. The result: thousands of unmanageable protected areas and native peoples reduced to poaching and trespassing on their ancestral lands or &#x201c;assimilated&#x201d; but permanently indentured on the lowest rungs of the money economy. Dowie begins with the story of Yosemite National Park, which by the turn of the twentieth century established a template for bitter encounters between native peoples and conservation. He then describes the experiences of other groups, ranging from the Ogiek and Maasai of eastern Africa and the Pygmies of Central Africa to the Karen of Thailand and the Adevasis of India. He also discusses such issues as differing definitions of &#x201c;nature&#x201d; and &#x201c;wilderness,&#x201d; the influence of the &#x201c;BINGOs&#x201d; (Big International NGOs, including the Worldwide Fund for Nature, Conservation International, and The Nature Conservancy), the need for Western scientists to respect and honor traditional lifeways, and the need for native peoples to blend their traditional knowledge with the knowledge of modern ecology. When conservationists and native peoples acknowledge the interdependence of biodiversity conservation and cultural survival, Dowie writes, they can together create a new and much more effective paradigm for conservation.</p></p><p>Award-winning journalist Mark Dowie is the author of <i>Losing Ground: American Environmentalism at the Close of the Twentieth Century, American Foundations: An Investigative History</i> (both published by the MIT Press), and four other books.Starred Review. With a beautiful balance of critique and sympathy, Dowie (<i>Losing Ground</i>) challenges the halos of the major multinational conservation nonprofits, including the Nature Conservancy and the Worldwide Fund for Nature, in this expos� of their disastrous treatment and expulsions of indigenous peoples living in nature reserves and parks. Dowie traces the myth of wilderness as an idealized version of nature to John Muir, the Godfather of Conservation, who denied that Indians ever lived in Yosemite despite their longtime cultivation of the area; he was revolted by their eating habits and uncleanliness and said they had no place in the landscape. This American concoction of a pristine wilderness park, and the idea that humans are not a part of nature, was exported throughout the world, wreaking havoc among both dislocated indigenous people and the environments that they had nurtured with traditional knowledge, for hundreds, even thousands of years. Dowie comes to a surprisingly optimistic conclusion, noting recent collaborations between indigenous peoples and conservation organizations&#x2014;who are beginning to realize that only by preserving cultural diversity can biological diversity be protected, and vice versa. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Upon hearing about the dragon, Elmer stows away on a ship and travels to Wild Island to rescue the dragon. The perfect bedtime story.</p><p><i>My Father's Dragon</i>--a favorite of young readers since the 1940s and a Newbery honor book--captures the nonsensical logic of childhood in an amusingly deadpan fashion. The story begins when Elmer Elevator (the narrator's father as a boy) runs away with an old alley cat to rescue a flying baby dragon being exploited on a faraway island. With the help of two dozen pink lollipops, rubber bands, chewing gum, and a fine-toothed comb, Elmer disarms the fiercest of beasts on Wild Island. The quirky, comical adventure ends with a heroic denouement: the freeing of the dragon. Abundant black-and-white lithographs by Ruth Chrisman Gannett (the author's stepmother) add an evocative, lighthearted mood to an already enchanting story. Author Ruth Stiles Gannett 's stand-alone sequel, <i>Elmer and the Dragon,</i> and her third volume, <i>The Dragons of Blueland</i> both received starred reviews in <i>School Library Journal</i> and are as fresh and original as her first. <i>(Ages 4 to 8)</i>When Elmer Elevator hears about the plight of an overworked and underappreciated baby flying dragon, he stows away on a ship and travels to Wild Island to rescue the dragon.</p><h2>The Variety of Life: A Survey and a Celebration of All the Creatures that Have Ever Lived</h2><p>Here, between the covers of one capacious book, is an illustrated summary of all the creatures that have ever lived, a vast compendium of earth's current and former inhabitants in all their dazzling and infinite diversity.<br> Colin Tudge argues that we are entering a new phase of biology in which, for the first time, biologists are achieving profound insight into life's true diversity and developing the tools to keep track of it. <em>The Variety of Life</em> heralds this new phase. The first part of the book describes why biologists now feel that there could have been as many as 4,000 billion species on Earth since life began. It then discusses the need for classification, beginning with the most basic principles--the strictly practical classification of fishmongers and foresters, who speak of "shellfish" and differentiate "hardwood" from "softwood"--and moves on to explore the intriguing deliberations of the modern "transformed cladists" and the novel contributions of molecular genetics. Part II describes the creatures themselves. It is divided into 24 sections, each describing a different group, illustrated by nearly 50 double-page spreads which present genealogical "trees" that summarize the evolutionary relationships between the creatures in each group. Some sections describe large, comprehensive groups such as the kingdoms of the Animals or the Plants. Others treat similar sub-groups in more detail, such as the Mammals, a class, or the Hominids, a family. In lively and accessible prose, all the significant groups of creatures--both alive and extinct--are described and their relationships clarified.<br> For general readers and serious biologists alike, <em>The Variety of Life</em> offers an unprecedented storehouse of knowledge of life on earth.</p><p>It takes a brave writer to tackle the truly Herculean task of describing <i>The Variety of Life</i> with the astronomical numbers of organisms living today, let alone all those that have fallen by the wayside over the billions of years of life on Earth. No one is quite sure how many living species there are, but it is estimated to be somewhere between 10 million and 100 million. Fortunately, since the days of the great Swedish naturalist Linnaeus, around 250 years ago, life has been grouped and classified into hierarchical schemes. As a result, it is possible to encompass this enormous variety of life by describing the relatively few groups into which it can be clustered. And, since the mid-19th century and the Darwin-Wallace theory of evolution by natural selection, classification has taken on an extra, evolutionary dimension.<p> Colin Tudge, a well-known British science writer, has training in whole animal biology and a self-proclaimed love for the natural-historical foray among our fellow creatures. The first part of this big book (all of 90 pages) deals with the thorny problems of what Tudge rightly calls the craft and science of classification. Since the 1950s, the word <i>cladistics</i> has terrorized many traditional naturalists and biologists. But it is here to stay, and Tudge provides a very welcome guide that will be invaluable to both lay people and students.</p><p> The bulk of the text, nearly 500 pages, forms part II and includes the descriptions of the main groups, from the most primitive (alpha proteobacteria) prokaryotes to <i>Eupatorium</i>, a large genus of 1,800 or so species of plant. In between these two groups, at either end of the biological spectrum, lie all the more familiar bugs and beasts, including ourselves. Inevitably, given so many millions of organisms, difficult choices have to be made. Some groups are only dealt with at phylum level (for example, brachiopods), while others are detailed down to family level (for example, primates). Some extinct groups (not surprisingly, the dinosaurs) get a look, but not many overall. The short epilogue concerns conservation and is followed by a useful reference list of sources and an index. Altogether, the 600-odd pages are enlivened with a large number of excellent black-and-white drawings of individual organisms and diagrams illustrating evolutionary relationships. For all natural historians and anyone interested in biology, the <i>The Variety of Life</i> is a must. <i>--Douglas Palmer, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><br><strong>Colin Tudge</strong>, a former features editor for <em>New Scientist</em>, is the author of <em>Global Ecology, Last Animals in the Zoo, The Environment of Life,</em> (OUP) and many other books.

Through a uniquely rich and comprehensive model, this revised edition continues to show how real-world policy grows out of differing ideals, even definitions, of basic societal goals like security, equality, and liberty. The book also demonstrates how these ideals often conflict in policy implementation.<br> <br> In this revised edition, Stone has added a full-length case study as an appendix, taking up the issue of affirmative action. Clear, provocative, and engaging, <em>Policy Paradox</em> conveys the richness of public policy making and analysis.</p><p></p><h2>The Warden</h2><p>Septimus Harding is an unworldly, cello-playing clergyman, beloved by the pensioners of Barchester's almshouse, of which he is warden. When ecclesiastical and political skulduggery engulf him, he is pulled in two directions.<br>This is the first of the six Barchester novels. <br>Trollope will remain one of the most trustworthy . . . of the writers who have helped the heart of man to know itself. --Henry James --<br></p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.The first of Trollope&#39;s popular Barsetshire novels, set in the fictional cathedral town of Barchester, &#34;The Warden centers on the honorable cleric Septimus Harding, one of Trollope&#39;s most memorable characters. When Harding is accused of mismanaging church funds, his predicament lays bare the complexities of the Victorian world and of nineteenth-century provincial life. And, as Louis Auchincloss observes in his Introduction, &#34;The theme of &#34;The Warden presents the kind of social problem that always fascinated Trollope: the inevitable clash of ancient privilege with modern social awareness.&#34;</p><h2>Dan Burley&#39;s Jive</h2><p><p>This retro volume combines two brilliant and long out-of-print books, Dan Burley�s Original Handbook of Harlem Jive (1944) and Diggeth Thou? (1959) by Dan Burley, with an introduction by Thomas Aiello. Burley was a journalist and sportswriter who worked for various African American newspapers and magazines, including the Chicago Defender, Chicago Crusader, New York New Amsterdam News, Jet, and Ebony in both Chicago and New York in the 1920s through the 1950s. Although he did not invent jive, throughout the 1940s Burley�s Handbook fostered it, popularized it, and broadened its use beyond the cloister of the jazz community. Jive acted as an invisible conduit between the new urban linguistics and the inevitably square world. <br> <br>Burley�s goal was to inform readers about this new language, as well as to entertain. Dan Burley�s Original Handbook of Harlem Jive offers a history of and definition for jive, followed by examples of folktales, poetry, and Shakespeare \u201ctranslated\u201d into jive. The work also includes a jive glossary for easy reference. Burley followed up the success of the Handbook with Diggeth Thou?, which includes more stories told in jive. These rare books sparkle with wit and humor and offer a flashback to the world of New York�s and Chicago�s hepcats and chicks. Aiello�s work will allow Burley�s fascinating take on jive to reach a new generation of readers and scholars.</p></p><p><p>Thomas Aiello is a visiting professor of history at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.</p><p>""This book is a gem, and its reprinting highlights the contributions of one of the most creative and socially-conscious wordsmiths in American history."&#x2015;H.

Far from the somberly clad, stern, and righteous figures children learn about in school, many of the early settlers of Plymouth actually dressed in bright colors, drank heavily, and often got into trouble. <br><br>A surprising new look at America's founding fathers and mothers, <i>The Times of Their Lives</i> presents a realistic, factual account of the Plymouth colony based on contemporary archaeology, cultural research, and living history. Taking little known trial transcripts, personal accounts, wills and probate records, as well as physical artifacts such as shards and spoons unearthed from old foundations, James and Patricia Deetz reveal what life in seventeenth century Plymouth was really like. In the process they blow the dust off the dull, wooden figures of tradition and show the people of Plymouth as vibrant individuals who lived out complex and colorful lives in a world profoundly different than our own. <br><br>Beginning with an eyewitness account of the first Thanksgiving, <i>The Times of Their Lives</i> offers an often startling portrait of Plymouth Colony that includes aspects of the legal system, folk beliefs, family life, women&#x2019;s roles and gender issues, eating habits, alcohol use, sexual misconduct, domestic violence, suspicious deaths, and violent crimes. <br><br>The result is an impeccably researched and highly imaginative work that shakes up our view of one of the most cherished myths of American history.<br><br></p><p>"No one is able better to interpret the material culture and lived history of the Pilgrims of Plymouth than James Deetz, and this book is the full harvest of his long and fruitful scholarship. Giving new life to an old myth, Dietz demonstrates that as far as Plymouth and the Pilgrims are concerned, the past is not what it used to be, and probably never was. Meticulous, generous, and irreverent, this work partakes of those same qualities that describe the career of one of America's foremost cultural anthropologists. He has written an instant classic." <br><br> --Peter J. Gomes, Harvard University, former Librarian and President of the Pilgrim Society of Plymouth <p>"With its riveting history and graceful prose, <i>The Times of Their Lives</i> will transport readers back to the seventeenth-century world of Plymouth, Massachusetts. At the same time the book urges us to consider the present, especially our tenacious hold on the nation's cherished Pilgrim myths. Thoughtful, provocative, creative, and inclusive, this book will engage any student of American history and culture. It's the next best thing to time travel." <br><br> --Elizabeth Reis, Department of History, University of Oregon, author of <i>Damned Women: Sinners and Witches in Puritan New England</i> </p><p>"There is no one who could possibly know more on a firsthand basis about life, love, and death at the 17th century American colony of Plymouth, Massachusetts than Jim Deetz.

Nor were they nearly as pious as we've been led to believe: they wore brightly colored clothing, drank heavily, had adulterous affairs, and committed both petty and serious crimes against their neighbors.

The inventive collaboration between Koolhaas and designer Bruce Mau is a graphic overture that weaves together architectural projects, photos and sketches, diary excerpts, personal travelogues, fairy tales, and fables, as well as critical essays on contemporary architecture and society.<br><br> The book's title is also its framework: projects and essays are arranged according to scale. While Small and Medium address issues ranging from the domestic to the public, Large focuses on what Koolhaas calls "the architecture of Bigness." Extra-Large features projects at the urban scale, along with the important essay "What Ever Happened to Urbanism?" and other studies of the contemporary city. Running throughout the book is a "dictionary" of an adventurous new Koolhaasian language -- definitions, commentaries, and quotes from hundreds of literary, cultural, artistic, and architectural sources.</p><p>This extraordinary, massive, and mind-boggling 1,300-page book combines essays, manifestos, diaries, fairy tales, travelogues, a cycle of meditations on the contemporary city--and complex illustration--with work produced by Koolhaas&#39; Office for Metropolitan Architecture over the past twenty years. This almost overwhelming accumulation of words and images illuminates the condition of architecture today--its splendors and miseries--exploring and revealing the corrosive effects of politics, context, the economy, and globalization. In some ways, this is the &#34;Medium is the Message&#34; of 1990s architectural discourse: guaranteed to be hugely influential in the coming decades, but grossly misunderstood by those who have not read it. The core arguments it makes about metropolitan architecture--accepting complexity and lack of centralized control--are similar to those of Kevin Kelly&#39;s Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems and the Economic World. Very highly recommended.<b>Rem Koolhaas </b>is founder of the Office for Metropolitan Architecture (O.M.A.); the firm's most important projects include the Lille Grand Palais in Lille; the Kunsthal in Rotterdam; Netherlands Dance Theatre in The Hague; Nexus Housing in Fukuoka; the Dutch House in Holland; and Villa dall'Ava in Paris, all of which are included in <i>S,M,L,XL</i>.

In his native Sweden, Linnaeus is revered by children as the "Prince of Flowers" and by adults as a great biologist, the author of classics on natural history, and, owing to his impassioned study of the sex life of plants, as history's foremost "botanical pornographer."</p><br><p> Linnaeus was of pivotal importance in the Age of Enlightenment. Though an adventurous traveler, keen collector, zoologist, and geologist, he loved botany most of all. The son of a pastor, he believed he was chosen by God to resolve the jumbled classification of the natural world. Through his <i>Systema Naturae</i>, first published in 1735, he brought order to all recorded knowledge about living things, distinguishing and naming 7,700 plants and 4,400 animals in his lifetime.</p><br><p> This book gives a fascinating and rounded portrait of Linnaeus the man, charting his rise from a poor student at Lund University to Professor of Medicine at Uppsala and a founder of the Royal Academy of Sciences. Wilfrid Blunt's engaging text is interspersed with vivid passages from his subject's own writings--from riveting descriptions of adventures in the wilds of Lapland to a charming account of Sjupp the raccoon. Linnaeus's family life and his relations with pupils are explored alongside his epoch-making scientific achievements. William Stearn's appendix on Linnean classification provides a concise survey of the basics necessary for understanding Linnaeus's work.</p><br><p> Impeccably researched and highly readable, this biography is ideal for anyone interested in botany, zoology, or mineralogy, as well as naturalists and gardeners. It brings the world of Linnaeus alive with over 200 beautiful illustrations, including evocative photographs and exquisite eighteenth-century botanical drawings, paintings, and engravings.</p></p><p><p>"This evocative account of Linnaeus's life and achievements has become a natural history classic. Wilfrid Blunt beautifully captures Linnaeus's zest for botany and its key place in the intellectual ferment of the eighteenth century, showing how the Linnean system was used by plant explorers from America to Japan to Lapland and helped establish the foundation of modern botanical science--as well as introducing new species to gardens all over the world. The impact of this system on the culture of Linnaeus's day was incalculable, ranging from the classification of diseases to fashionable illustrative art or spicy innuendo in writing about the sex life of plants. And the man himself was lively and likeable, with an eye for a joke in naming species after friends or enemies. This new edition of Blunt's story of the "Prince of Flowers" will make a very welcome addition to any plant-lover's library."<b>--Janet Browne, author of <i>Charles Darwin: Voyaging</i></b></p><b>Wilfrid Blunt</b> was Senior Drawing Master at Eton College. An Associate of the Royal College of Art and a fellow of the Linnean Society of London, he authored a number of biographies and books on European art and botany.

Claudius has survived the murderous intrigues of his predecessors to become, reluctantly, Emperor of Rome. Here he recounts his surprisingly successful reign: how he cultivates the loyalty of the army and the common people to repair the damage caused by Caligula; his relations with the Jewish King Herod Agrippa; and his invasion of Britain. But the growing paranoia of absolute power and the infidelity of his promiscuous young wife Messalina mean that his good fortune will not last forever. In this second part of Robert Graves&#39;s fictionalized autobiography, Claudius - wry, rueful, always inquisitive - brings to life some of the most scandalous and violent times in history. If you enjoyed Claudius the God, you might like Marguerite Yourcenar&#39;s Memoirs of Hadrian, also available in Penguin Modern Classics. &#39;I, Claudius and Claudius the God are an imaginative and hugely readable account of the early decades of the Roman Empire ... racy, inventive, often comic&#39; Daily Telegraph &#39;One of the really remarkable books of our day, a novel of learning and imagination, fortunately conceived and brilliantly executed&#39; The New York Times &#39;Graves made Roman history funny and familiar&#39; Guardian</p><p>14 1.5-hour cassettesRobert Graves begins anew the tumultuous life of the Roman who became emporer in spite of himself.

In writing the novel, Bront� drew on her own experiences, and one can trace in the work many of the trials of the Victorian governess, often stranded far from home, and treated with little respect by her employers, yet expected to control and educate her young charges. <em>Agnes Grey</em> looks at childhood from nursery to adolescence, and it also charts the frustrations of romantic love, as Agnes starts to nurse warmer feelings towards the local curate, Mr. Weston. Sally Shuttleworth's fascinating introduction considers the book's fictional and narrative qualities, its relationship with Victorian child-rearing and the responsibilities of parents, and the changing attitudes to the book influenced by modern concerns for children's rights. The new edition includes a revised and updated bibliography as well as revised notes drawing on the latest critical material.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Unfortunately, Agnes cannot anticipate the hardship, humiliation, and loneliness that await her in the brutish Bloomfield and haughty Murray households. Drawn from Anne Bronte&#39;s own experiences, &#34;Agnes Grey depicts the harsh conditions and class snobbery that governesses were often forced to endure. As Barbara A. Suess writes in her Introduction, &#34;Bronte provides a portrait of the governess that is as sympathetic as her fictional indictment of the shallow, selfish moneyed class is biting.&#34;</p><h2>Romeo and Juliet (Shakespeare Graphics)</h2><p>The tragic story of two star-crossed lovers from different worlds comes to life in graphic novel format. Romeo, from the Montague family, and Juliet, of the Capulet clan, fall deeply in love at first sight. Fearful of punishment from their respective factions, the two teens keep their love hidden from everyone. However, when their commitment to each other is exposed, it adds more fuel to the heated family feud between the Capulets and Montagues and puts their love and their lives at risk.</p><p>Since 1986, Martin Powell has been a freelance writer.

Nevertheless, the literature on the life and work of Einstein, extensive as it is, does not provide an adequate account of his religious conception and sentiments. Only fragmentarily known, Einstein's ideas about religion have been often distorted both by atheists and by religious groups eager to claim him as one of their own. But what exactly was Einstein's religious credo? In this fascinating book, the distinguished physicist and philosopher Max Jammer offers an unbiased and well-documented answer to this question.</p><br><p> The book begins with a discussion of Einstein's childhood religious education and the religious atmosphere--or its absence--among his family and friends. It then reconstructs, step by step, the intellectual development that led Einstein to the conceptions of a cosmic religion and an impersonal God, akin to "the God of Spinoza." Jammer explores Einstein's writings and lectures on religion and its role in society, and how far they have been accepted by the general public and by professional theologians like Paul Tillich or Frederick Ferr�. He also analyzes the precise meaning of Einstein's famous dictum "Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind," and why this statement can serve as an epitome of Einstein's philosophy of religion.</p><br><p> The last chapter deals with the controversial question of whether Einstein's scientific work, and in particular his theory of relativity, has theologically significant implications, a problem important for those who are interested in the relation between science and religion. Both thought-provoking and engaging, this book aims to introduce readers, without proselytizing, to Einstein's religion.</p></p><p><br><p>"No other work offers as broad an account of Einstein's views on the relationship between science and religion or brings together all of the different facets of the topic in one short, easily accessible account. Einstein and Religion also offers a badly needed critique of some of the many misinterpretations and misuses of Einstein's views. Professor Jammer is a noted scholar, science historian, and philosopher with the credentials to write authoritatively on this subject."<b>--David Cassidy, author of<i>Uncertainty: The Life and Science of Werner Heisenberg</i><br></b><br></p><br><b>Max Jammer</b> is Professor of Physics Emeritus and former Rector at Bar-Ilan University in Israel. He is the author of a number of treatises on the foundations of physics, including <i>Concepts of Space</i>, which contains a preface by Albert Einstein, and <i>The Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics</i>, which was read in draft by Paul Dirac and Werner Heisenberg. For his publications, most of which have been translated into several languages, Jammer has received numerous awards, among them the prestigious Monograph Prize of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

It argues that the ways in which we intently look at or listen to anything result from crucial changes in the nature of perception that can be traced back to the second half of the nineteenth century.</p><p>Focusing on the period from about 1880 to 1905, Jonathan Crary examines the connections between the modernization of subjectivity and the dramatic expansion and industrialization of visual/auditory culture. At the core of his project is the paradoxical nature of modern attention, which was both a fundamental condition of individual freedom, creativity, and experience and a central element in the efficient functioning of economic and disciplinary institutions as well as the emerging spaces of mass consumption and spectacle.</p><p>Crary approaches these issues through multiple analyses of single works by three key modernist painters&#x2015;Manet, Seurat, and Cezanne&#x2015;who each engaged in a singular confrontation with the disruptions, vacancies, and rifts within a perceptual field. Each in his own way discovered that sustained attentiveness, rather than fixing or securing the world, led to perceptual disintegration and loss of presence, and each used this discovery as the basis for a reinvention of representational practices.</p><p><i>Suspensions of Perception</i> decisively relocates the problem of aesthetic contemplation within a broader collective encounter with the unstable nature of perception&#x2015;in psychology, philosophy, neurology, early cinema, and photography. In doing so, it provides a historical framework for understanding the current social crisis of attention amid the accelerating metamorphoses of our contemporary technological culture.</p></p><p>Jonathan Crary is Meyer Schapiro Professor of Modern Art and Theory at Columbia University.

Written in a lively, accessible manner for a general audience by a leading academic expert, this book is unique in its authority, approach and scope. Martin Kitchen focuses particularly on the German people - their culture and society. In this way he illuminates and puts into perspective the country&#39;s political history, from its origins as a collection of small, German-speaking states to its present-day status as a major European and world power. In special illustrated boxes and panels throughout the book, he reveals the great cultural and intellectual contribution Germans have made to the world through the works of figures such as Martin Luther, Bach, Kant, Wagner, and Gropius.</p><p>The Cambridge Illustrated History of Germany presents a richly illustrated, integrated, chronological account of German history from Charlemagne to the modern era. Unique in its approach and scope, the book focuses on German culture, illuminating and putting into perspective the country&#39;s varied political history.A splendidly written narrative, this glossy volume can attract the attention of new students <i>and</i> veteran scholars of the wild ups and downs of German history. Aided by a plethora of color images, Kitchen exerts his appeal by keeping before the reader the abiding questions of the country's identity: who is a German, and where is Germany? Answering these questions, Kitchen delivers an interpretive accounting of political structures from the Holy Roman Empire to the latest reunified state. Necessarily simplifying without being simplistic, the author touches the essentials that have shaped, and haunted, the country: Luther, the Reformation, the Thirty Years War, the ascendance of Prussia, the Napoleonic impact, and the disasters of the twentieth century. All is not goose-stepping and war, though. Kitchen encapsulates in illustrated sidebars the Germans' signal cultural achievements in music, painting, and literature, spanning such varied artists as Bach and Grosz. With such breadth combined with depth in the crucial periods, Kitchen offers libraries an excellent resource. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>The EQ Edge: Emotional Intelligence and Your Success (Jossey-Bass Leadership Series - Canada)</h2><p><b>A FULLY REVISED AND UPDATED EDITION OF THE INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER</b> <p>What does it take to be a firefighter?

It covers such topics as: the work on self as integral to organizational change; the revision of Lewinian concepts for a new era; and the history behind &#x201c;getting everybody improving whole systems&#x201d; as a response to fast change and increasing diversity (not the same as using any particular method). The themes, case studies (many revisited), and models are as relevant as ever.</p></p><p><p>Praise for Productive Workplaces</p> <p>"Weisbord has been a major voice in the theory and practice of organization development (OD) since the early 1970's.

Weisbord showshow "experts solving problems" evolved toward "getting everybodyimproving whole systems," and why the latter strategy is the onlyone likely to satisfy you in a diverse world of non-stopchange.</p><p>From his work in corporations and medical schools, Weisborddemonstrates how novel practices grounded in scientific management,participative management, and sociotechnical systems&#x2014;all basedon shared values of ration- al cooperation&#x2014;became obsoleteover time. He traces today's practices back more than 100 years,using his experiences as manager and consultant to illuminate whatworks and what doesn't.

He goes further, advocating work on self&#x2014;e.g.,awareness of your own assumptions about human nature&#x2014;as thebedrock for change strategies that trump "shorter, faster,cheaper." His themes, illustrative case studies, and useful modelscome across as relevant today as they were a quarter of a centuryago.</p><p>This third edition includes many new features&#x2014;a robustInstructor's Manual, a revisioning of organization developmentmyths, a critical appreciation of new large group methods, casestudy follow-ups across 15 to 30 years, and 40 personal essays bypractitioners influenced by earlier editions.

But there is no public protection or security without a coercive state. Does this mean that any freedom we enjoy is a superficial good that presupposes a deeper, political form of subjection? Philip Pettit addresses this crucial question in On the People&#39;s Terms. He argues that state coercion will not involve individual subjection or domination insofar as we enjoy an equally shared form of control over those in power. This claim may seem utopian but it is supported by a realistic model of the institutions that might establish such democratic control. Beginning with a fresh articulation of republican ideas, Pettit develops a highly original account of the rationale of democracy, breathing new life into democratic theory.</p><p>Drawing on the work of historians like Quentin Skinner, neo-republican theory offers a new perspective on the theory of justice and democracy. This is the first extended statement of a republican theory of democracy. It gives a fresh account of the rationale of democracy and the institutions that democracy requires.Philip Pettit is L. S. Rockefeller University Professor of Politics and Human Values at Princeton University, New Jersey and also Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the Australian National University, Canberra. His books include The Common Mind, Republicanism, Rules, Reasons and Norms and Made with Words: Hobbbes on Language, Mind and Politics. Among his recent co-authored books are The Economy of Esteem, with Geoffrey Brennan; A Political Philosophy in Public Life, with Jose Marti; and Group Agency, with Christian List.

Includes new material on various aspects of witchcraft from the Middle Ages through to the 17th century.</p><p><p> <i>"Brian Levack's aims are to provide a coherent introduction to the subject and contribute to an ongoing scholarly debate.&nbsp; In both these aims - but particularly in the former - he has succeeded magnificently. ...it will serve as a standard introduction to the topic for many years to come."</i>&nbsp;So wrote Brian Easlea in the English Historical Review of this famous book when it first appeared in 1987.&nbsp; It focuses on the great age of witch-hunting in Europe (and also in colonial America), between 1450 and 1750.&nbsp; In these years more than 100,000 people - most of them women - were prosecuted by secular and ecclesiastical courts across Europe for allegedly practising harmful magic and worshipping the Devil.&nbsp; The book sets out to answer the major questions that this strange and terrible phenomenon evokes today:&nbsp;* Why did the trials take place?&nbsp; * Why did they suddenly proliferate in Europe at this time?&nbsp; How many trials were there, and where, and what were their outcomes?&nbsp; * Why were more witches prosecuted in some countries than others?&nbsp; * Who were the accused and who were their accusers?&nbsp; * Why, after more than 200 years of vigorous activity, did the trials eventually dwindle away?&nbsp; * What do they tell us about the social, economic and political history of early modern Europe - and, in particular, the position of women within it?&nbsp;In this timely Second Edition, Brian Levack now incorporates the latest scholarship on the subject.&nbsp; The general lines of his argument remain as before, but numerous new regional and local studies (many on the periphery of Europe) have made possible a fuller treatment of the witch-hunt, and a more detailed analysis of its chronological and geographical distribution.&nbsp; He also includes new material on the development of witch-beliefs in the Middle Ages; on the social dimension of witchcraft; and on the connection between witch-hunting and the Protestant and Catholic Reformations.&nbsp; The notes and bibliography have been greatly expanded, and the book has been entirely reset.&nbsp;<i>"(He) has produced a valuable synthesis of the materials currently available, and his text will prove a lifeline to many students."</i>Martin Ingram, European History Quarterly&nbsp;<i>"Now, at last, with Brian Levack's careful, scholarly and critical survey, a thoroughly reliable introduction to the whole literature is available.&nbsp; Levack appears to have read every significant work, both new and old and in most relevant languages, and has judiciously sifted out the information, pondered on it, and come up with balanced and sensible verdicts."</i>Henry Kamen, History Today&nbsp;<i>"Levack's logical sorting of a prodigious amount of material has resulted in one of the most informative and comprehensive works of its genre."</i>Hans Sebald, American Historical Review&nbsp;BRIAN P. LEVACK is Professor of History in the University of Texas at Austin.</p><p> <b>Brian Levack</b> grew up in a family of teachers in the New York metropolitan area. From his father, a professor of French history, he acquired a love for studying the past, and he knew from an early age that he too would become a historian. He received his B.A. from Fordham University in 1965 and his Ph.D. from Yale in 1970. In graduate school he became fascinated by the history of the law and the interaction between law and politics, interests that he has maintained throughout his career. In 1969 he joined the History Department of the University of Texas at Austin, where he is now the John Green Regents Professor in History. The winner of several teaching awards, Levack teaches a wide variety of courses on British and European history, legal history, and the history of witchcraft. For eight years he served as the chair of his department, a rewarding but challenging assignment that made it difficult for him to devote as much time as he wished to his teaching and scholarship. His books include <i>The Civil Lawyers in England, 1603-1641: A Political Study (1973), The Formation of the British State: England, Scotland and the Union, 1603-1707 (1987),</i> and <i>The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe (1987 and 1995),</i> which has been translated into eight languages. </p><p> His study of the development of beliefs about witchcraft in Europe over the course of many centuries gave him the idea of writing a textbook on Western civilization that would illustrate a broader set of encounters between different cultures, societies, and ideologies. While writing the book, Levack and his two sons built a house on property that he and his wife, Nancy, own in the Texas hill country. He found that the two projects presented similar challenges: it was easy to draw up the design, but far more difficult to execute it. When not teaching, writing, or doing carpentry work, Levack runs along the jogging trails of Austin, and he has recently discovered the pleasures of scuba diving. </p></p><h2>A Natural History of the Chicago Region (Center for American Places - Center Books on American Places)</h2><p>In <i>A Natural History of the Chicago Region</i>, Joel Greenberg takes readers on a journey that begins in 1673 with Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet&#x2014;the first Europeans known to have visited the Chicago region&#x2014;and that we're still on today. This is a fascinating story, told with humor and passion, of forests battling prairies for dominance; of grasslands plowed, wetlands drained, and species driven to extinction in the settlement of the Midwest; and of caring conservationists fighting to preserve and restore the native plants and animals. Intermingling historical anecdotes and episodes straight from the words of early settlers and naturalists with current scientific information, Greenberg places the natural history of the region in a human context, showing how it affects our everyday existence in even the most urbanized landscape of Chicago.<br></p><p>If you had canoed in July of 1673 with Father Jacques Marquette and Louis Joliet-the first Europeans known to have visited the Chicago region-you would have passed through a landscape harboring a biological richness in some ways unsurpassed anywhere else on the planet. Poised on the fertile borderlands where hardwood forests met tallgrass prairies, and rivers and streams meandered through expansive wetlands and into vast lakes, the area teemed with wildlife. And if you were a nineteenth-century visitor in what is now-and was then-the heart of downtown Chicago, you might have been overtaken by a group of men with guns and knives hunting an errant bear who had wandered into the city from the prairie to the west. While Chicago may be known today as a city of "wild life," from Al Capone to the Playboy headquarters, Joel Greenberg dazzles readers with the story of Chicago's true and enduring wildlife.<br><br>In the sweeping <i>A Natural History of the Chicago Region</i>, Greenberg takes you on a journey that begins with European explorers and settlers and hasn't ended yet. Along the way he introduces you to the physical forces that have shaped the area from southeastern Wisconsin to northern Indiana and Berrien County in Michigan; the various habitat types present in the region and how European settlement has affected them; and the insects, reptiles and amphibians, birds, fish, and mammals found in them, then amidst the settlers and now amidst the skyscrapers. In all, Greenberg chronicles the development of 19 counties in Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin across centuries of ecological, technological, and social transformations.<br><br>This is a fascinating story told with humor and passion, of forests battling prairies for dominance; of storms battering towns and lakes; of prairies plowed, wetlands drained, and species driven extinct in the settlement of the Midwest; and of caring conservationists fighting to preserve and restore the native plants and animals. Drawing on historical sources as well as current scientific information, Greenberg places the natural history of the region in a human context, showing how it affects our everyday existence in even the most urbanized landscapes.<br><br>Encyclopedic, compelling, and compassionate, <i>A Natural History of the Chicago Region</i> is the definitive chronicle of the natural life of a major urban area and has much to offer historians as well as any fan of natural history, from birders, hikers, and paddlers to restorationists and ecologists. You will be captivated by everything from the spotted touch-me-not to the coyotes found in the city's most exclusive neighborhoods.<b>Joel Greenberg</b> is a lawyer, naturalist, and writer who has worked for a number of environmental organizations.

This provocative history of ideas traces the cannibal's appearance throughout Western thought, first as a creature springing from the menagerie of natural law, later as a diabolical retort to theological dogmas about the resurrection of the body, and finally to present-day social, ethical, and political debates in which the cannibal is viewed through the lens of anthropology or invoked in the service of moral relativism.</p><br><p> Ultimately, <i>An Intellectual History of Cannibalism</i> is the story of the birth of modernity and of the philosophies of culture that arose in the wake of the Enlightenment. It is a book that lays bare the darker fears and impulses that course through the Western intellectual tradition.</p></p><p><p>"In intellectual history, cannibals stand for alien and exotic human beings, specimens of our species who realize its darkest possibilities, usually in places far removed from civilization. Cannibalism both expresses natural law and contravenes it. Avramescu's book is a tour de force. It explains not only why the figure of the cannibal used to be ubiquitous in moral philosophy, but why it has become extinct."<b>--Tom Sorell, University of Birmingham</b></p><p>"In this brilliant book, Catalin Avramescu reexamines the Western tradition of social and political thought, restoring our obsession with cannibalism to its proper place in the European imagination. His erudition is overwhelming as he traces the figure of the cannibal, both fascinating and horrifying, through the period when the modern world was being born. Avramescu shows us our history and ourselves in a completely original and gripping way. An Intellectual History of Cannibalism is a real tour de force."<b>--Daniel Garber, Princeton University</b></p><p>"Avramescu's wonderful study treats the cannibal as a scholarly creature who animates theoretical texts. Avramescu provides his readers with a comprehensive view of the various theories and visions of cannibalism. There is no book quite like this. Cannibalism is at the extreme limit of human thought and language. Avramescu allows us to see why, and he does it very well."<b>--Timo Airaksinen, author of <i>The Philosophy of the Marquis de Sade</i></b></p><p>"This is a splendid book. <i>An Intellectual History of Cannibalism</i> is a persuasive study of European ideas about cannibalism in relation to theories of natural law and the state of nature. Avramescu defends an original thesis about the site of absolute cruelty in political philosophies of early modern and modern societies. His historical knowledge is stunning. His interpretations are always sober and convincing/"<b>--Thomas Pavel, University of Chicago</b></p><p>"A very exciting and original contribution to our understanding of various approaches to cannibalism from the viewpoint of intellectual history. <i>An Intellectual History of Cannibalism</i> adds significantly to our grasp of the nature of evil and its tortuous itineraries within modern civilization. Avramescu offers us a provocative, challenging book on a topic that bears upon the political and moral catastrophes of modern times."<b>--Vladimir Tismaneanu, University of Maryland</b></p><b>C&#x103;t&#x103;lin Avramescu</b> is reader in political science at the University of Bucharest and a docent in philosophy at the University of Helsinki.</p><h2>The Art of War (Chiltern Classic)</h2><p>Believed to have been first published more than two thousand years ago, The Art of War is the classic Chinese book of military strategy. It has not only influenced many of the world&#x2019;s most powerful military leaders but has also been adapted to teach winning strategies in business, politics and everyday relationships.</p><p>Sun Tzu was an ancient Chinese military general, strategist and philosopher, who is believed to have written the famous ancient Chinese book on military strategy, &#x201c;The Art of War&#x201d;. Through his legends and the influential &#x201c;The Art of War&#x201d;, Sun Tzu had a significant impact on Chinese and Asian history and culture. The book drew immense popularity during the 19th and 20th centuries when the Western Society saw its practical use. This work still has continued its impact on both Asian and Western culture and politics.</p><h2>Symbolic Exchange and Death (Theory, Culture &amp; Society)</h2><p>Jean Baudrillard is one of the most celebrated and most controversial of contemporary social theorists. This major work, appearing in English for the first time, occupies a central place in the rethinking of the humanities and social sciences around the idea of postmodernism.<p></p> <p></p> <p>It leads the reader on an exhilarating tour encompassing the end of Marxism, the enchantment of fashion, symbolism about sex and the body, and the relations between economic exchange and death. Most significantly, the book represents Baudrillard&#x2032;s fullest elaboration of the concept of the three orders of the simulacra, defining the historical passage from production to reproduction to simulation.</p> <p></p> <p>A classic in its field, <b>Symbolic Exc</b></p></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: FrenchThis is easily Baudrillard&#x2032;s most important work. It is a key intervention in the debates on modernity and postmodernity and the site of his postmodern turn. Anyone who wants to understand the complexity and provocativeness of Baudrillard&#x2032;s richest period must read this text. Author: Douglas Kellner<br><br>Without doubt Baudrillard&#x2032;s most important book. Author: Mike Gane<br><br>Baudrillard&#x2032;s most widely admired text, or at least, as he himself once wryly observed, "the last book that inspired any confidence".... For anyone seeking a way into Baudrillard&#x2032;s highly inventive, uncompromising, and occasionally maddening oeuvre,&nbsp;<em>Symbolic Exchange and Death</em>&nbsp;is still one of the best places from which to start. Author: Radical Philosophy<br><br>Baudrillard has a warm glow of nostalgia about his earlier work. He claims it is "the last book that inspired any confidence". If the newly translated <em>Symbolic Exchange and Death</em>&nbsp;had been available earlier, the perception of Baudrillard as a postmodernist playboy might have been different. It bridges the gap between his early serious work and the later funny work.<br> <br> Author: The Modern Review<br><br><p>Arguing that a political economy predicted on commodity value has long since been replaced by the political economy of the sign, Baudrillard traces the hyperrealist consequences of the "end of production" through chapters focusing on fashion, the body and death. The seeming inevitability of the triumph of the "semiotic" commodity over "symbolic" (gift) exchange is shown to be an error perpetrated by Marxist theory, which has itself been absorbed into "the code" that governs the transformation of value. Baudrillard&#x2032;s intention is to defeat the code by turning its own logic against it, inverting Marx, Freud, and finally Saussure in an effort to abolish "value" itself. His analysis is carried along on its own rhetorical force... achieves extraordinary insight into the malaise pervading late-capitalist societies.</p> <em><br> </em> <p>&nbsp;</p> Author: Choice</p><h2>The Getaway Car: A Donald Westlake Nonfiction Miscellany</h2><p><p>Over the course of a fifty-year career, Donald E. Westlake published nearly one hundred books, including not one but two long-running series, starring the hard-hitting Parker and the hapless John Dortmunder. In the six years since his death, Westlake&#x2019;s reputation has only grown, with fans continuing to marvel at his tightly constructed plots, no-nonsense prose, and keen, even unsettling, insights into human behavior.<br> <br> With <i>The Getaway Car</i>, we get our first glimpse of another side of Westlake the writer: what he did when he wasn&#x2019;t busy making stuff up. And it&#x2019;s fascinating. Setting previously published pieces, many little seen, alongside never-before-published material found in Westlake&#x2019;s working files, the book offers a clear picture of the man behind the books&#x2014;including his thoughts on his own work and that of his peers, mentors, and influences. The book opens with revealing (and funny) fragments from an unpublished autobiography, then goes on to offer an extended history of private eye fiction, a conversation among Westlake&#x2019;s numerous pen names, letters to friends and colleagues, interviews, appreciations of fellow writers, and much, much more. There&#x2019;s even a recipe for Sloth � la Dortmunder. Really.<br> <br> Rounded out with a foreword by Westlake&#x2019;s longtime friend Lawrence Block, <i>The Getaway Car</i> is a fitting capstone to a storied career and a wonderful opportunity to revel anew in the voice and sensibility of a master craftsman.</p></p><p><b>Donald E. Westlake </b>(1933&#x2013;2008) was a prolific author of crime fiction. In 1993, the Mystery Writers of America bestowed the society&#x2019;s highest honor on Westlake, naming him a Grand Master. <b>Levi Stahl</b> is the promotions director of the University of Chicago Press.&#x201c;This is a book for everyone, anyone who likes mystery novels or good writing or wit and passion and intelligence, regardless of their source.&#x201d; (<i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The great Donald E. Westlake, author of some of the best puzzles of the 20th century, turns out to have been a terrific essayist and correspondent, too. Reading this collection of nonfiction is like becoming friends with a mystery novelist.&#x201d; (<i>Printer's Row</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This&nbsp;book doesn&#x2019;t disappoint. . . . Westlake was a hugely entertaining and witty writer. Whether he is writing a letter&nbsp;to his editor or about the history of his genre, he remains true to his definition of what makes a great writer: &#x2018;passion, plus craft.&#x2019;&#x201d; (P.D. Smith <i>Guardian</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Almost as much as he enjoyed writing crime novels, Westlake liked to write comments on his own work and on that of his contemporaries and predecessors in the genre. His list of written product includes countless essays, book introductions and prefaces, lists, letters and one memorial (to John D. MacDonald). It&#x2019;s from this treasure trove of material that an eager beaver academic named Levi Stahl at the University of Chicago has put together the valuable collection he titles <i>The Getaway Car</i>.&#x201d; (<i>Toronto Star</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A kind of posthumous autobiography, a selection of his occasional nonfiction that gives us a portrait of an interesting mind, a high-spirited friend, a shrewd critic, and a craftsman reflecting on his trade&#x2014;and of a kind of writing life that may no longer be available. It should appeal not only to fans of Westlake but to anyone who takes pleasure in seeing a job done well or reading a well-turned sentence.&#x201d; (David Guaspari <i>The New Criterion</i>)</p><h2>Principles of Population Genetics</h2><p>Principles of Population Genetics, Third Edition, provides a balanced presentation of theory and observation for students at the undergraduate and graduate levels. In response to suggestions from students and instructors, the book has been trimmed more than 100 pages and rewritten with the goal to optimize its use as a teaching aid. It introduces the principles of genetics and statistics that are relevant to population studies, and examines the forces affecting genetic variation from the molecular to the organismic level. Integrated throughout the book are descriptions of molecular methods used to study variation in natural populations, as well as explanations of the relevant estimation theory using actual data. Chapter 1 presents the fundamental genetic and statistical concepts in population genetics. Chapter 2 reviews the types and prevalence of genetic variation in natural populations. This is followed in Chapter 3 by a detailed examination of the implications of random mating for one locus and multiple loci. Chapter 4 examines population subdivision and its consequences for the distribution of genetic variation among subpopulations, including the hierarchical F statistics used in estimating these effects. Chapters 5 through 7 deal with mutation, migration, natural selection in all its varieties, and the consequences of random genetic drift. Molecular population genetics, including coalescent theory, is the subject of Chapter 8. Quantitative genetics is covered in Chapter 9, from the standpoint of genetic variance and covariance components as well as with respect to molecular markers used to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Applications of principles discussed in the text are illustrated by numerous examples of worked problems, using actual data. Each chapter end, in addition to a complete summary, offers several problems for solution, to reinforce and further develop the concepts.</p><p><br><strong>Daniel L.

So argues Efraim Karsh in this highly provocative book. Rejecting the conventional Western interpretation of Middle Eastern history as an offshoot of global power politics, Karsh contends that the region&#x2019;s experience is the culmination of long-existing indigenous trends, passions, and patterns of behavior, and that foremost among these is Islam&#x2019;s millenarian imperial tradition.<br> The author explores the history of Islam&#x2019;s imperialism and the persistence of the Ottoman imperialist dream that outlasted World War I to haunt Islamic and Middle Eastern politics to the present day. September 11 can be seen as simply the latest expression of this dream, and such attacks have little to do with U.S. international behavior or policy in the Middle East, says Karsh. The House of Islam&#x2019;s war for world mastery is traditional, indeed venerable, and it is a quest that is far from over.</p><p><b>Efraim Karsh</b> is professor and head of the Mediterranean Studies Programme, King&#x2019;s College, University of London.<p>"In <i>Islamic Imperialism</i> Efraim Karsh argues for the existence of an Islamic imperial drive and traces it from Muhammad's time to current Islamist aggressions. One can hardly imagine a thesis with larger implications for prosecuting the war on terror."&#x2014;Daniel Pipes<br><br></p> (Daniel Pipes)<br><br><p>&#x201c;Only a shrewd and talented revisionist, a professor with curiosity and nerve, could take on the clich�s of Middle East scholarship and insist that they be reconsidered. That describes Efraim Karsh, a much-published and much-admired professor at the University of London. His new book, <i>Islamic Imperialism</i> deserves serious consideration by anyone who cares about this debate. He challenges not only our favourite ideas about the Middle East but even our notions of imperialism. . . . Karsh&#x2019;s view of rising Islamic imperialism chills the blood. Multiculturalism looks different through the lens of his scholarship, and so does the future for global politics.&#x201d;&#x2014;Robert Fulford, <i>Canada National Post</i></p><p><i></i>&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> (Robert Fulford <i>Canada National Post</i>)<br><br>"Karsh's lively, clearly written and well-researched account should have an appeal beyond an academic audience. The crisp manner with which he disposes of accepted wisdom will delight the reader. And in laying to rest the victim theory, he restores a measure of dignity to the Middle East."&#x2014;Ralph Amelan, <i>Jerusalem Post</i><i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p> (Ralph Amelan <i>Jerusalem Post</i>)</p><h2>The Neoliberal City: Governance, Ideology, and Development in American Urbanism</h2><p><p>The shift in the ideological winds toward a "free-market" economy has brought profound effects in urban areas. The Neoliberal City presents an overview of the effect of these changes on today's cities. The term "neoliberalism" was originally used in reference to a set of practices that first-world institutions like the IMF and World Bank impose on third-world countries and cities. The support of unimpeded trade and individual freedoms and the discouragement of state regulation and social spending are the putative centerpieces of this vision. More and more, though, people have come to recognize that first-world cities are undergoing the same processes.</p><p>In The Neoliberal City, Jason Hackworth argues that neoliberal policies are in fact having a profound effect on the nature and direction of urbanization in the United States and other wealthy countries, and that much can be learned from studying its effect. He explores the impact that neoliberalism has had on three aspects of urbanization in the United States: governance, urban form, and social movements. The American inner city is seen as a crucial battle zone for the wider neoliberal transition primarily because it embodies neoliberalism's antithesis, Keynesian egalitarian liberalism. Focusing on issues such as gentrification in New York City; public-housing policy in New York, Chicago, and Seattle; downtown redevelopment in Phoenix; and urban-landscape change in New Brunswick, N.J., Hackworth shows us how material and symbolic changes to institutions, neighborhoods, and entire urban regions can be traced in part to the rise of neoliberalism.</p></p><p>"Drawing from geography, urban studies, and political science, The Neoliberal City&nbsp;is a good introduction to many debates in those disciplines&nbsp;and to some&nbsp;important arguments about the neoliberal city. Jason Hackworth's discussion of liberalism and neoliberalism is particularly valuable for its clarity and because it provides a punchy and well-argued account of the intellectual development of neoliberalism. By focusing on the roles of bond-rating agencies, real-estate agents, developers, and public housing authorities, Jason Hackworth successfully reveals the internal processes of neoliberalism in action." - Joe Painter, University of Durham<p>Jason Hackworth is Associate Professor of Geography and Planning at the University of Toronto.</p></p><h2>The African American Urban Experience: Perspectives from the Colonial Period to the Present</h2><p>From the early years of the African slave trade to America, blacks have lived and laboured in urban environments. Yet the transformation of rural blacks into a predominantly urban people is a relatively recent phenomenon - only during World War One did African Americans move into cities in large numbers, and only during World War Two did more blacks reside in cities than in the countryside. By the early 1970s, blacks had not only made the transition from rural to urban settings, but were almost evenly distributed between the cities of the North and the West on the one hand and the South on the other. In their quest for full citizenship rights, economic democracy, and release from an oppressive rural past, black southerners turned to urban migration and employment in the nation&#39;s industrial sector as a new &#39;Promised Land&#39; or &#39;Flight from Egypt&#39;. In order to illuminate these transformations in African American urban life, this book brings together urban history; contemporary social, cultural, and policy research; and comparative perspectives on race, ethnicity, and nationality within and across national boundaries.</p><p>"Historians and general readers alike owe a debt to Joe W. Trotter, Earl Lewis, and Tera W. Hunter for this wide-ranging, deep-running, interdisciplinary study of African-American urban history. Placing African Americans at the center of their investigation, they show the complexities of class, gender, and race in urban life.

Filling that void, this unique text covers both new and existing information following a stepwise approach on theory, planning, implementation, and evaluation methods for the restoration of stream habitats. Comprehensively illustrated with case studies from around the world,&nbsp;<i>Stream and Watershed Restoration</i> provides a systematic approach to restoration programs suitable for graduate and upper-level undergraduate courses on stream or watershed restoration or as a reference for restoration practitioners and fisheries scientists.<br> <br> <i>Part of the Advancing River Restoration and Management Series.&nbsp;</i></p> <p><b>Additional resources for this book can be found at:</b> <b>www.wiley.com/go/roni/streamrestoration</b><b>.</b></p></p><p><p>This book was born out of the clear need for a comprehensive resource for developing successful stream and watershed restoration plans and projects. It provides a systematic and adaptable approach for planning, prioritizing, implementing, and evaluating restoration at the regional, watershed, reach and project level. The reader will gain an understanding of stream and restoration ecology, methods for assessing watershed conditions and identifying restoration actions, different restoration techniques and their benefits and shortcomings, how to prioritize restoration actions, how to implement projects on the ground, and how to design a rigorous monitoring and evaluation program. It is organized in a stepwise fashion covering the key aspects of aquatic restoration including: assessing watershed and riverine processes and conditions, identifying restoration opportunities, choosing appropriate restoration techniques, prioritizing restoration actions, monitoring and implementation. It is intended as a guide for practitioners, an instructional manual for educators and students and a general reference for those interested in or active in the field of aquatic and restoration ecology.</p><p>Dr. Philip Roni has 25 years&#x2019; experience working in and conducting research on streams and watersheds in North America and Europe.

The Plains Indians: Artists of Earth and Sky celebrates the extraordinary beauty, power, and spiritual resonance of Plains Indian art throughout time. Richly illustrated, this monumental volume includes a wealth of masterworks from European and North American collections, ranging from a 2,000-year-old Human Effigy stone pipe to a 2011 beaded adaptation of designer shoes. Works of art collected centuries ago by French traders and travelers are presented together with those acquired by Lewis and Clark on their famous expedition of 1804&#x2013;6, along with objects from the early reservation era and contemporary works based in traditional forms and ideas. The distinct Plains aesthetic&#x2015;intertwined with the natural world, ephemeral, and materially rich&#x2015;is revealed through an array of forms and mediums: painting and drawing; sculptural works in stone, wood, antler, and shell; porcupine quill and glass bead embroidery; feather work; painted robes depicting figures and geometric shapes; and richly ornamented clothing and ceremonial objects. Many nations are represented&#x2015;Osage, Quapaw, Omaha, Crow, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Lakota, Blackfeet, Pawnee, Kiowa, Comanche, Mesquakie, Kansa, and others. With newly researched texts by leading scholars, this important book charts the continuum of centuries of artistic tradition and reflects the significant place that Plains Indian culture holds in European history and in the heritage of North America.</p></p><p><p>Gaylord Torrence is the Fred and Virginia Merrill Senior Curator of American Indian Art at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City, and professor emeritus in fine arts, Drake University, Des Moines.</p></p><h2>Bengali (Teach Yourself)</h2><p>This course in spoken and written Bengali is for beginners or for those who want to brush up on rusty skills.

J�rgen Osterhammel, an eminent scholar who has been called the Braudel of the nineteenth century, moves beyond conventional Eurocentric and chronological accounts of the era, presenting instead a truly global history of breathtaking scope and towering erudition. He examines the powerful and complex forces that drove global change during the "long nineteenth century," taking readers from New York to New Delhi, from the Latin American revolutions to the Taiping Rebellion, from the perils and promise of Europe's transatlantic labor markets to the hardships endured by nomadic, tribal peoples across the planet. Osterhammel describes a world increasingly networked by the telegraph, the steamship, and the railways. He explores the changing relationship between human beings and nature, looks at the importance of cities, explains the role slavery and its abolition played in the emergence of new nations, challenges the widely held belief that the nineteenth century witnessed the triumph of the nation-state, and much more.</p><p>This is the highly anticipated English edition of the spectacularly successful and critically acclaimed German book, which is also being translated into Chinese, Polish, Russian, and French. Indispensable for any historian, <i>The Transformation of the World</i> sheds important new light on this momentous epoch, showing how the nineteenth century paved the way for the global catastrophes of the twentieth century, yet how it also gave rise to pacifism, liberalism, the trade union, and a host of other crucial developments.</p></p><p><p>"J�rgen Osterhammel is the Braudel of the nineteenth century. His global panorama is a triumph of the historian's craft. In elegant and lucid prose, he examines, across the entire world, the Janus face of the era: both distant past and yet also origin of our contemporary condition."<b>--Jonathan Sperber, author of <i>Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life</i></b></p><p>"The comparison with Braudel's magnum opus is not misplaced. Osterhammel's <i>The Transformation of the World</i> is a brilliant work of historical imagination, of absolutely show-stealing erudition, and of wide-apertured original insight! Reflecting on space and time, empire and slavery, war and peace, economy and diplomacy, monarchy and opera, and much else, Osterhammel changes our whole understanding of the nineteenth century."<b>--Helmut W. Smith, Vanderbilt University</b></p><p>"This big, kaleidoscopic book follows the many strands of change over the course of a long century of transformation. It belongs on a short list of key resources for understanding the origins of many of the challenges we face today."<b>--John E. Wills, Jr., University of Southern California</b></p><p>"Arguably the most important book by a German historian to be published in the past quarter century. It is a truly magisterial account of the global history of the nineteenth century, powerfully argued and beautifully rendered."<b>--Sven Beckert, author of <i>The Monied Metropolis: New York City and the Consolidation of the American Bourgeoisie, 1850-1896</i></b></p><b>J�rgen Osterhammel</b> is professor of modern and contemporary history at the University of Konstanz.

This edition includes new decisions of the National Labor Relations Board appointed by President Obama, which has departed in important ways from the approach of the Board under the prior administration. Moreover, the Board is now actively confronting the role of labor law in the contemporary workplace, addressing emergent issues such as protections for employee electronic communications and social media interactions, accountability for employers in &#x201c;fissured&#x201d; enterprises, and potential limitations on other employer restrictions on collective activity. The book also contains judicial decisions addressing these developments as well as reactions in Congress and elsewhere, evincing the growing polarization over the role of labor unions in society.<br><br>This edition supplies a comprehensive revision in light of major legal shifts occurring from 2013 through 2015, notably<br><ul><li>the new NLRB representation election rules</li><li><i>Purple Communications,</i> adopting new rules on employee use of employer email for concerted activity</li><li><i>Murphy Oil,</i> reiterating <i>D.F.

For twenty-one days, you will put away your credit cards and buy only what you need for survival. With Michelle&#39;s guidance during this three-week financial fast, you&#39;ll discover how to: * Break your spending habit * Handle money with your significant other or your spouse * Break your bondage to debt with the Debt Dash Plan * Make smart investments * Be prepared for any contingency with a Life Happens Fund * Stop worrying about money and find the priceless power of financial peace As you discover practical ways to achieve financial freedom, you&#39;ll experience something even more amazing ... your faith and generosity will increase, too.</p><p>Prosperity is part of God's plan for us. This book gives us biblical principles and practical tools to achieve the prosperity God promises. Too often the greatest reason folks are in financial trouble is because they shop to buy things they really don't need with money they don't have.<br> <br> Using biblical principles, Singletary teaches readers the essentials of becoming financially fit by putting them on a 21-day financial fast. This financial fast requires that readers stop using their credit cards for 21 days. They have to refrain from buying anything but the bare essentials, such as food and medicine. <br> <br> They can't shop. They can't even window shop. They can't eat out. They can't use credit. <br> <br> This financial fast will help readers achieve financial deliverance. They will break the bond that shopping or unwise credit card usage has had on their lives. Even readers who consider themselves good stewards over their money will be surprised how much money they spend even as they bargain shop. <br> <br> Singletary gives the reasons why handling your money following biblical principles will lead to prosperity. If people had followed core financial principles outlined in the Bible--the borrower is slave to the lender--we wouldn't be in the mess we are in right now.<br> <br> As Singletary speaks at more and more churches, she is often asked for a book that frames personal finance in terms of good stewardship using Scriptures. That's not something I was free to do in my first book. <br> That's where this book is different. She hits people hard and makes them think; for example, if they are Christian, are they handling their money as they should? Are they rejecting tithing because they truly don't believe in it or because they are just too broke to see the blessing behind it?Michelle Singletary writes an award-winning personal finance column for The Washington Post called &#39;The Color of Money,&#39; which appears in more than one hundred newspapers across the country. The author of two other books, Singletary has appeared on numerous national television and radio programs, including Oprah, The Today Show, The Early Show, The View, Meet the Press, CNN, MSNBC, Nightline, Tavis Smiley, NPR, The Diane Rehm Show, The Tom Joyner Morning Show, and Yolanda Adams Morning Show.

Additionally, <em>The Stage Manager's Toolkit</em> provides a good overview of stage management for interested nonspecialist staff and faculty members who teach or supervise young stage managers. No single book can ever completely encompass the possible permutations and idiosyncrasies of production that a stage manager navigates on a regular basis. Stage-management training requires practical experience working on productions. Theatre will always be a live and collaborative art; we all learn how to do it from one another, face-to-face, and in real time.

Kincman effectively draws on communication theory and practical experience to address effective organizational and communication strategies in the day-to-day duties of the stage manager in academic and professional venues.

High school and college stage managers often create all their paperwork from scratch, so having these templates is very helpful. From rehearsal reports to scene-shift plots, blocking notation guides to run sheets and cue lists, Kincman describes how each works and why each is used...Another highlight is the beginning of this book, where Kincman discusses communication. I love that <em>Toolkit </em>starts with communication. It is the base of <em>everything </em>I do as a stage manager and effective collaborator...this book gives you exactly what you need to better understand the role of a stage manager." </strong><em>Don Corathers, Dramatics</em></p> <p><strong>"Like an air traffic controller, the stage manager must juggle multiple responsibilities and communicate quickly and clearly.

The grid created the physical conditions for business and society to flourish and embodied the drive and discipline for which the city would come to be known. Published to coincide with an exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York celebrating the bicentennial of the Commissioners' 1811 Plan of Manhattan, this volume does more than memorialize such a visionary effort, it serves as an enduring reference full of rare images and information.<br><br><i>The Greatest Grid</i> shares the history of the Commissioners' plan, incorporating archival photos and illustrations, primary documents and testimony, and magnificent maps with essential analysis. The text, written by leading historians of New York City, follows the grid's initial design, implementation, and evolution, and then speaks to its enduring influence. A foldout map, accompanied by explanatory notes, reproduces the Commissioners' original plan, and additional maps and prints chart the city's pre-1811 irregular growth patterns and local precedent for the grid's design. Constituting the first sustained examination of this subject, this text describes the social, political, and intellectual figures who were instrumental in remaking early New York, not in the image of old Europe but as a reflection of other American cities and a distinct New World sensibility. The grid reaffirmed old hierarchies while creating new opportunities for power and advancement, giving rise to the multicultural, highly networked landscape New Yorkers thrive in today.</p><p>Hilary Ballon is deputy vice chancellor of New York University Abu Dhabi, part of the leadership team developing the school's new, full-scale campus and establishing its identity as a global university.

Located sixty miles south of the Mason-Dixon Line, the nation&#39;s capital was surrounded by the slave states of Maryland and Virginia. With no fortifications and only a handful of trained soldiers, Washington was an ideal target for the Confederacy. The South echoed with cries of &#34;On to Washington!&#34; and Jefferson Davis&#39;s wife sent out cards inviting her friends to a reception at the White House on May 1. Lincoln issued an emergency proclamation on April 15, calling for 75,000 troops to suppress the rebellion and protect the capital. One question now transfixed the nation: whose forces would reach Washington first-Northern defenders or Southern attackers? For 12 days, the city&#39;s fate hung in the balance. Washington was entirely isolated from the North-without trains, telegraph, or mail. Sandbags were stacked around major landmarks, and the unfinished Capitol was transformed into a barracks, with volunteer troops camping out in the House and Senate chambers. Meanwhile, Maryland secessionists blocked the passage of Union reinforcements trying to reach Washington, and a rumored force of 20,000 Confederate soldiers lay in wait just across the Potomac River.

That&#x2019;s the philosophy behind this confidence-building, sanity-saving book. Fostering organized thinking in your child will help with concrete concerns (think a tidier bedroom!) and build critical life skills like learning to plan and grasping the big picture. Dr. Korb&#x2019;s 5 Steps to <i>Raising an Organized Child</i> apply to all ages. So, whether you have an infant or a teenager, it&#x2019;s never too late (or too early!) to foster organization in him or her and harmony in your whole family. <i>Raising an Organized Child</i> presents specific activities for your child&#x2019;s age and developmental level to improve executive function. No matter if your child is just your average chaotic kid or struggling with additional challenges like ADHD, you can boost your child&#x2019;s organization and lower your frustration with Dr. Korb&#x2019;s guidance.</p><p><b>Damon Korb, MD, FAAP,&nbsp;</b>is a practicing developmental and behavioral pediatrician and founder of the Center for Developing Minds.

Korb provides suggestions and tasks geared to four main age groups&#x2014;infants, preschoolers (3&#x2013;5 years), school-age children (5&#x2013;12), and teenagers&#x2014;for both parent and child. However, for each age group, the &#x2018;five steps&#x2019; remain the same: &#x2018;be consistent,&#x2019; &#x2018;introduce order,&#x2019; &#x2018;give everything a place,&#x2019; &#x2018;practice forward thinking,&#x2019; and &#x2018;promote problem-solving.&#x2019; Throughout, Korb includes scripts for productive parent-child conversations and skill-developing games geared to different ages. Korb also traces how, as children advance in age and organizational skills, parental roles change, from &#x2018;coach&#x2019; to school-age children to &#x2018;manager&#x2019; for middle schoolers, and &#x2018;consultant&#x2019; for high schoolers. Korb&#x2019;s examples are educational, especially one he shares to illustrate overbearing parenting&#x2014;that of a couple who gave their high schooler son, on average, five hours of help with homework each night, resulting in disaster when he left the parental umbrella and entered college. Korb thus shows both how adults can help and when and why they need to let &#x2018;go of control.&#x2019; The result is a kind, supportive guide that parents and children alike can profit from as they grow together." &#x2014;&nbsp;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><h2>Schaum&#39;s Outline of Calculus (Fourth Edition)</h2><p><p>Students can gain a thorough understanding of differential and integral calculus with this powerful study tool.

The authors describe the quilt's physical characteristics&#x2014;size, fabrics, pattern, method of quilting, quality of workmanship, and overall design concept. They also offer stories and photos of the quiltmaker and her family and the circumstances under which the quilt was made, when known. </p> <p> In their introduction, the authors provide a historical overview of quiltmaking in Texas and discuss how quilts have come to be perceived as works of art, rather than mere decorative crafts. This documentation and the on-going Texas Quilt Search that they direct underline Bresenhan and Puentes' commitment to preserving and encouraging this art. Through these efforts, they hope to encourage young Texans to "appreciate the beauty of quilts, value the inspiration, commitment and hard work it takes to produce them, and feel a sense of kinship with all of the creative women who have ensured that quilting does not become a lost art." </p></p><p></p><h2>Medieval Monasticism: Forms of Religious Life in Western Europe in the Middle Ages</h2><p>Hugh Lawrence&#39;s book ranges right across Europe and the Middle East as well as reconstructing the internal life, experience and aims of the medieval cloister, he also explores the many-sided relationships between the monasteries and the secular world from which they drew recruits.

This book marks a glorious new installment in that history of courageous, even outrageous Jewish thought; between its covers is a gathering of one of the lost tribes (perhaps the thirteenth?): midrashists of the body and its texts, close readers and theorizers of sexual appetite and gender. It usefully situates some of the central figures of queer theory in a Jewish context and simultaneously displays them at their sharpest, exploring the intimately, inextricably intertwined legacies of opprobrium of Jewishness and queerness, their generative dialogue of analogy and antagonism, and the manifestation of that dialogue in cultural production, both mainstream and marginal, and in modern history, comical, farcical, tragic. It&#39;s illuminating, hugely informative, and sexy as only rigorous and playful intelligence applied to transgressive subjects can be.&#34; -Tony Kushner</p><h2>Antonello da Messina: Inside Painting</h2><p><p><b>The essential book on the Italian master of perspective and portraiture</b><br>Antonello da Messina is one of the earliest virtuosos of oil painting, a true Renaissance master who&#x2015;via the influence of the Flemish painters&#x2015;raised perspective and geometric rigor to new heights of clarity and serenity. His mastery of the three-quarter profile portrait is another of his key accomplishments. With 300 color plates, and at 340 pages, this book is the most comprehensive monograph available in English, and the first substantial Antonello publication in decades. Today Antonello is most celebrated for paintings such as his <i>Crucifixion</i> in Bucharest and the <i>Salvator Mundi</i>, <i>Madonna with Child</i> and <i>Saint Jerome in His Study</i> in London. These works, alongside his portraits, embody his accomplishments in realism and the steady, calm atmosphere he brought to Italian painting.This exceptional publication fills a longstanding and conspicuous gap in the literature on Italian Renaissance art. <b>Antonello da Messina</b> (c. 1430&#x2013;79) was one of the most groundbreaking and influential painters of the Quattrocento. Born in Sicily and trained in Naples where he studied the work of Proven�al and Flemish artists, he is often supposed to have encountered the pioneering art of Van Eyck at this time, whose influence he seems to have imported into Italy. Antonello's impact was particularly keenly felt in Venice, where he lived from 1475 to 1476; within a short time of his arrival, his work attracted so much favorable attention that he was supported by the Venetian state and local painters enthusiastically adopted his oil technique and compositional style.</p></p><p></p><h2>Write Stuff Adventure (Exploring the Art of Writing)</h2><p>This creative writing course was specifically written by a seasoned professional for homeschool use.

It can often seem like everything in a city is man-made, all concrete, steel, and glass. But even the asphalt jungle is not all asphalt&#x2014;a sidewalk&#x2019;s cracks are filled with nature, if we know where and how to look. To aid us in this quest is <i>Nature All Around Us,</i> which will help us to recognize (and look after) the natural world we traipse through in our daily lives.</p> <p><i><br> Nature All Around Us</i> uses the familiar&#x2014;such as summer Sundays humming with lawn mowers, gray squirrels foraging in planters, and flocks of pigeons&#x2014;in order to introduce basic ecological concepts. In twenty-five short chapters organized by scale, from the home to the neighborhood to the city at large, it offers a subtle and entertaining education in ecology sure to inspire appreciation and ultimately stewardship of the environment. Various ecological concepts that any urban dweller might encounter are approachably examined, from understanding why a squirrel might act aggressively towards its neighbor to how nutrients and energy contained within a discarded apple core are recycled back into the food chain. Streaming through the work is an introduction to basic ecology, including the dangers of invasive species and the crucial role played by plants and trees in maintaining air quality.</p> <p><br> Taken as a whole, <i>Nature All Around Us</i> is an unprecedented field guide to the ecology of the urban environment that invites us to look at our towns, cities, and even our backyards through the eyes of an ecologist. It is an entertaining, educational, and inspiring glimpse into nature in seemingly unnatural settings, a reminder that we don&#x2019;t have to trek into the wild to see nature&#x2014;we just have to open our eyes.</p> <br></p><p><b>Beatrix Beisner</b> is a professor in the Department of Biology at Montreal University in Quebec.&#x201c;Ladybugs and feral cats, vultures at garbage dumps, chimney swifts endangered by metal flues, all swirl along the boulevards and alleys of this&nbsp;ecological mosaic.

And by doing so, hopefully we&#x2019;ll realize that ecology is not just the domain of scientists, but something we can all practice and enjoy.&#x201d; (Robert Hammond, co-founder and executive director of Friends of the High Line)<br><br><p></p>&#x201c;This is an easily accessible first look at ecology on your doorstep. Those who want to know about the interconnectedness of the natural world will learn about the same principles that apply in a forest or on a mountain, yet closer to home. Moreover, the reader will learn that ecology is a science that helps explain the complex relationships between animals, plants and microorganisms with their environment. It does not imply a judgment, good or bad&#x2014;it helps us to look deeper past soundbites and easy fixes and provides a means to develop basic literacy in this important timely area of science.&#x201d;<p></p> (Nina Bassuk, Cornell University)<br><br>&#x201c;This is a clever book with a deep message. As the authors show with wit and charm, you don&#x2019;t need to venture into the wilderness to explore the natural world.

Calvin is a theoretical neurophysiologist at the University of Washington. He is the author of The Atlantic Monthlys cover story, The Great Climate Flip-Flop, and of ten books, including The Cerebral Code, How Brains Think, The Throwing Madonna, The River that Flows Uphill, The Cerebral Symphony, and co-author of Conversations with Neils Brain and Lingua ex Machina.Conversations with imaginary companions during an actual float trip down the Colorado River provide the structure upon which this discourse on evolution and its relation to the environment is built. Successive geological strata exposed by the river's slice through the Grand Canyon spur discussions among the voyagers, who contribute details from the scientific disciplines they represent. Calvin, author of Inside the Brain and The Throwing Madonna , provides little new information here. Rather, the book's value lies in its unique interweaving of geology, human evolution, anthropology, and ecology in a clear time setting.

He lives in Chevy Chase, Maryland.<p>Prologue</p> <p>Late in the afternoon of Wednesday, July 12, 2000, a bus carrying about a dozen &#x201c;high political rollers,&#x201d; as thirty-six-year-old Air Force Captain Scott Swanson viewed them, pulled up at Indian Springs Air Force Auxiliary Field, a broiling desert outpost northwest of Las Vegas. The visitors included the National Security Council&#x2019;s deputy counterterrorism chief, a senior official from the CIA&#x2019;s Counterterrorist Center, officials from other intelligence and military agencies, and the director of a shadowy Air Force technology shop known as Big Safari. Indian Springs was home to the 11th and 15th Reconnaissance Squadrons, units assigned to fly a relatively new unmanned, remote-control aircraft. Though the drone was equipped with nothing deadlier than daylight and infrared video cameras, it bore a menacing name: Predator.</p> <p>Swanson, a former special operations helicopter pilot, had flown Predators for the past two years, mostly in regular intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions over the Balkans. But soon he was to join Big Safari as that outfit&#x2019;s sole Predator pilot, which was why he had received a phone call from the Pentagon a few days earlier asking him to organize a show-and-tell session for those on the bus.</p> <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s going to be a bunch of people in suits,&#x201d; Swanson was told. &#x201c;Can you do a briefing on Predator and show them some capabilities in flight, but keep it quiet?&#x201d;</p> <p>On the other end of the call was Air Force Colonel James G. Clark, whose official title was technical director, simulation and integration, Office of the Assistant Vice Chief of Staff, Headquarters, U.S. Air Force. In reality, Clark worked for the service&#x2019;s two top leaders, the four-star chief of staff and the civilian secretary of the Air Force. He was their favorite fixer, an inside operator who was canny about how to bypass bureaucracy and who relished getting things done, as he liked to put it, &#x201c;quick and dirty.&#x201d; This was partly why Clark encouraged everyone to call him by his nickname, Snake&#x2014;or, if regulations required they salute him, Colonel Snake. He consciously cultivated the image of a shrewd and slippery operator who might be dangerous if stepped on, a reputation he found useful in intimidating real or potential opponents. For the past three years, the Predator had been Snake Clark&#x2019;s pet project, and for the past two years, Big Safari&#x2019;s as well.</p> <p>On the phone, Clark told Swanson the suits were coming to Indian Springs to get a better understanding of what they might expect from the Predator if it were used &#x201c;in a rugged part of the world.&#x201d; Clark slithered around the obvious question of what precise mission the government had in mind, but Swanson got the message. He read daily intelligence briefs and worked with intelligence officers, and he could guess which rugged part of the world, and even which country, was of such keen interest to these particular visitors.</p> <p>From their air-conditioned bus, the delegation climbed down into the shimmering desert heat at Indian Springs and filtered into an air-conditioned briefing room, where Swanson gave them a PowerPoint presentation on the Predator and what it could do. Introduced six years earlier under a new type of rapid Pentagon procurement program, the Predator was the military&#x2019;s first Medium Altitude Endurance Unmanned Aerial Vehicle&#x2014;a drone that could linger in the air well beyond twenty-four hours, pointing cameras at the earth and transmitting live video images back to its operators. The little aircraft owed its phenomenal endurance to its unique configuration, a design informed by its inventor&#x2019;s childhood hobby. The Predator had thin, tapered wings stretching forty-nine feet from tip to tip and a slender fuselage just under half that long, eight feet shorter than a Piper Cub&#x2019;s. Fashioned from lightweight composite materials, the fuselage was flat on the bottom, rounded on top, and bulged into a dome at the nose. With its flimsy wings and skin, the craft resembled a weekend hobbyist&#x2019;s glider and couldn&#x2019;t fly much faster. Powered by a four-cylinder engine akin to those used on snowmobiles, the small propeller on the plane&#x2019;s tail could push it through the air at a sluggish top speed of just over eighty miles an hour.</p> <p>Another reason the Predator could stay airborne for so long was that there was no pilot inside. Instead of a cockpit, the dome at the aircraft&#x2019;s nose housed a satellite dish; its two-member flight crew remained on the ground. Seated before an array of computers and color video screens in a metal box resembling a freight container, they flew the drone by remote control, using a satellite data link. As they did, one of the two crew members, designated the sensor operator, aimed and manipulated a turret under the Predator&#x2019;s chin that held two video cameras&#x2014;one to shoot color images in daylight, the other able to produce infrared images by detecting variations in temperature, whether by day or by night.</p> <p>As Swanson briefed them on the basics, his visitors interrupted with questions. Some wanted to know specifics about the Predator&#x2019;s speed, range, and endurance. Some wanted to know if the video from the Predator&#x2019;s cameras was sharp enough to identify an individual, and from what altitudes. Some wanted to know whether people on the ground could see the Predator or hear its engine. The visitors also wanted to know what tactics he would use to find a specific person and how hard that might be to do.</p> <p>Swanson&#x2019;s responses almost all began with &#x201c;It depends.&#x201d; But in order to better answer some of their questions, he invited his guests to follow him back out into the heat and down the Indian Springs flight line, where they could examine one of the faux freight containers the Air Force used to fly its small fleet of Predators.</p> <p>To tour the twenty-four-foot-long, eight-foot-wide, eight-foot-tall ground control station, known to insiders as a GCS, the members of the party had to take turns, entering two at a time. Before taking anyone inside, Swanson suggested that while his visitors waited, they might try to spot or hear a Predator; one was orbiting a mile or two from the airfield, he assured them, launched a bit earlier by a crew inside the GCS. The sky was clear and it was quiet around the desert airfield, but no one would detect the drone.</p> <p>Two by two, Swanson&#x2019;s guests entered the GCS through one of two large, meat-locker-style doors on one side of the container that were opened by swinging a big lever handle. It was chilly inside the dark compartment, where constant air-conditioning was necessary to keep the electronic equipment from overheating. Even in the desert, some of the Air Force people working in the GCS wore jackets.</p> <p>To their right as the visitors entered was the Predator&#x2019;s equivalent of a cockpit, a pair of identical consoles flush against the front wall, each faced by a brown, mock-leather chair for the flight crew that looked more comfortable than it was. In front of each chair was a keyboard; on a metal rack above the keyboard at each console were two nine-inch screens side by side that displayed data about the aircraft. Above the nine-inch screens were two nineteen-inch monitors for each console, one stacked above the other. The lower monitor normally displayed imagery, the upper one a moving map, although what they showed could be changed.</p> <p>Each console also featured controls much like those of a normal airplane&#x2014;or a video game. To the right of the keyboard at each console was a joystick with several buttons on it. To the keyboard&#x2019;s left was a lever that moved forward and back. The joystick on the left console normally governed the Predator&#x2019;s control surfaces; that console&#x2019;s lever was the aircraft&#x2019;s throttle. The joystick and lever on the right console normally served as the controls for the Predator&#x2019;s cameras&#x2014;the stick was used to aim them, the lever to zoom their view in or out. Below the two consoles were pedals that moved the drone&#x2019;s inverted-V tail like a rudder to help change the Predator&#x2019;s direction in flight. When the drone was on the ground, the pedals worked as brakes.</p> <p>Either console could be used to fly the Predator, but only one controlled the drone&#x2019;s flight at any given time. Normally that was the left console, and the Predator&#x2019;s pilot would sit in the left-hand chair; the right console was usually used to control the cameras, and the drone&#x2019;s sensor operator would sit in the right-hand chair. But with the push of a red button, the functions of the two consoles could be switched so that two pilots could sit at the flight consoles, the second officer serving as copilot to assist during takeoff or landing.</p> <p>Behind the flight crew were work stations holding computers, other electronic gear, and telephones used by intelligence analysts who typically worked in the GCS. Along the walls&#x2014;which were covered with thin synthetic paneling of the sort often seen in mobile homes&#x2014;were fold-down vinyl seats similar to the canvas ones in military transport planes, but without seat belts or shoulder harnesses. Toward the back of the container was a second meat-locker-type door, which, like the first, had to be opened and closed gently to avoid making noise that might distract those working inside.</p> <p>As each pair of guests stood behind the flight console chairs watching the Predator&#x2019;s video, the crew showed them the view through the color TV camera, useful only in daylight, then switched to the black-and-white infrared camera&#x2019;s view. The sensor operator also toggled the infrared sensor between its two modes, &#x201c;white hot&#x201d; and &#x201c;black hot,&#x201d; in which warmer objects looked either white or black in contrast to cooler objects. The crew focused and zoomed in on vehicles driving around the airfield, on individuals walking from place to place&#x2014;and then on the visitors standing just outside the door, waiting to enter the GCS. Swanson got the feeling the delegation was impressed; there were hushed conversations, whispers back and forth, and a lot of notes taken.</p> <p>Not long after the guests left, Swanson learned that his guess about their reaction to the demonstration must have been correct, as was his hunch about the mission they had in mind. The Predator was going to play hide-and-seek in Afghanistan with one of the world&#x2019;s most wanted men: the elusive leader of the Islamic fundamentalist terrorist group Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden. And when it did, Scott Swanson would be the chief pilot.</p> <p>Life with Big Safari was getting interesting in a hurry.</p> <p><br>This is the story of the first armed drone ever to be flown by intercontinental remote control and used to kill human beings on the other side of the globe. The military has long had an interest in unmanned aircraft, but before the Predator, drones were at best a niche technology. The Predator itself was widely ignored at first, until a series of iconoclastic visionaries began transforming it from a simple eye in the sky into an exotic new weapon. Once the Predator became capable of firing laser-guided missiles at enemies half a world away, military and industry attitudes toward such unmanned aerial vehicles changed nearly overnight. The drone revolution began.</p> <p>How and why that happened is a tale previously told only in dribs and drabs, and often inaccurately. This account is based on five years of reporting and hundreds of interviews with the insiders who made the Predator what it became&#x2014;an invention that not only changed the military, the CIA, and warfare itself, but also led the way into a new technological age. Drones of all kinds are now poised to transform civilian aviation, law enforcement, agriculture, and dozens of other human endeavors.</p> <p>This is the drone revolution&#x2019;s book of genesis, and like another creation story it opens near the confluence of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates. It begins with a boy in Baghdad.<br></p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by Richard Whittle<br></p></p><h2>Neuroanatomy</h2><p>Neuroanatomy through Clinical Cases brings a pioneering interactive approach to the teaching of neuroanatomy, using over 100 actual Clinical Cases and high-quality radiologic images to bring the subject to life. This approach allows students to appreciate the clinical relevance of structural details as they are being learned, and to integrate knowledge of disparate functional systems, since a single lesion may affect several different neural structures and pathways. <p>Most of the book comprises chapters that explain the major neuroanatomical systems. Each chapter first presents background material including an overview of relevant neuroanatomical structures and pathways, and a brief discussion of related clinical disorders. The second half of each chapter is devoted to clinical cases. The cases begin with a narrative of how the patient developed symptoms, and what deficits were found upon neurological examination. Boldface type highlights important symptoms and signs. A series of questions challenges the reader to deduce the neuroanatomical location of the patient's lesion, and the diagnosis. Discussion and answers follow, and an epilogue reveals the actual outcome. </p><p>One of the book's most innovative features is the inclusion of CT and MRI scans that depict each patient's lesion. These radiographs help the reader develop skills in interpreting the same kinds of diagnostic images employed in clinical practice. </p><p>The book is intended primarily for first- or second-year medical students enrolled in a basic neuroanatomy, neurobiology or neuroscience course. It is also a valuable resource for advanced medical students and residents, as well as students of other health professions, notably physical therapy, occupational therapy, nursing, dentistry, speech therapy, and neuropsychology.</p></p><p>HAL BLUMENFELD is Assistant Professor in the Departments of Neurology and Neurobiology at Yale University School of Medicine.Neuroanatomy through Clinical Cases seems a slam-dunk into the classics shelf. -- <i>Andres Martin, Jos� Merino, Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences</i></p><h2>Jesus, Day by Day: A One-Year, Through-the-Bible Devotional to Help You See Him on Every Page</h2><p><b>This unique 365-day devotional infuses your daily Bible reading with deeper meaning, helping you develop the habit of looking for signs of Jesus woven throughout Scripture while meditating on the Bible with a chronological one-year reading plan.</b><br><br>Jesus is the very essence of the Scriptures.

Sharon and her husband, Ray, live in Scottsdale, Arizona, with their two children.<p><b>Come and See Jesus</b></p><p>I remember it like it was yesterday. I sat on my bed, a typical 1980s teenager, my Bible laid out in front of me. An industrious kid with a hint of mischievousness, I wasn&#x2019;t older than eight when I started a &#x201c;private school&#x201d; for the neighborhood kids one summer. I even charged tuition! But there was a problem. I could barely read and hated trying. I&#x2019;d been diagnosed with a plethora of learning disabilities, and my reading comprehension was dismal. I&#x2019;d recently become aware of another big problem: my heart was full of sin.</p><p>I sat there on my bed that day with a decision to make: whether I would give my life fully to Christ or live for myself. I had one request and prayed, <i>Lord, I&#x2019;ll follow You. Just please let me read Your Word and understand it</i>. I opened up my Bible, and for the first time I understood what I was reading! Even more miraculous was the fact that I loved it.</p><p>Over time God began to transform my mind. Through Bible college, undergraduate school, law school, and into my law career, I considered God&#x2019;s Word my anchor, but I often meandered through devotions, wondering where to read. Then in 2001 I was introduced to the <i>One Year Chronological Bible</i>. This reading plan went through the entire Bible in one year and put the Scriptures in the order the events occurred. My devotions were revolutionized. I no longer wondered what to read; it was mapped out. I no longer got lost in the order of events; they were organized. I no longer left parts of God&#x2019;s Word unread; they were all part of the reading plan. Even if I skipped days or weeks, I could jump right back in and know where to pick up. And I was reading through the Bible each year! A glorious accomplishment.</p><p>What truly transformed my relationship with God&#x2019;s Word, however, was learning to read it not as a collection of stories or principles but as a single narrative focused on one vital truth. In Bible college I learned theology. In law school I learned to look at things analytically. Both are useful in life as well as when approaching the Scriptures. But what you and I need most of all is Jesus! If we approach life without Him, we will be lost. If we approach His Word without looking for Him, we will miss the point. Jesus said to the Pharisees, &#x201c;You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; it is these that testify about Me&#x201d; (John 5:39, NASB).</p><p>Jesus is the very essence of the Scriptures. The Old Testament points to Him, and the New Testament reveals Him. If we look for Him, we will find Him on every page and in every story. After all, He is the Word made flesh (John 1:14). As we approach His Word looking for Him, we find purpose to even those &#x201c;boring&#x201d; chapters in Leviticus. Seeing Jesus gives meaning to the Old Testament sacrifices, purpose in the rejection and heartache of Joseph, hope pictured in the sweet love story of Ruth and Boaz, and a reason for even the deepest sorrows in Job. Truly, Jesus Christ is the focal point of the Bible from the beginning to the end. He is our beloved hope.</p><p>The power of reading with this one vital truth in mind is what I&#x2019;m excited to share with you in the pages that follow.</p><p><br><b>Let&#x2019;s Begin</b></p><p>This devotional follows a chronological reading plan, which means the Scripture readings are organized into the order that the events historically took place. If you read each of the assignments in these daily devotionals, in one year you will have read through the entire Bible!</p><p>These 365 daily readings are designed to help you</p><p>~&nbsp; create a pattern of looking for Jesus throughout the Scriptures</p><p>~&nbsp; develop a love for the Bible as you study the purpose of the Old Testament and how it correlates with the New Testament</p><p>~&nbsp; maintain interest throughout the year by highlighting prophecies of Jesus&#x2019;s birth, death, resurrection, and return</p><p>~&nbsp; grow in your love for Jesus as you read the testimonies of His saints and understand how God used their lives to foreshadow Christ</p><p>Your journey through the Bible will lead you from the perfect creation in Genesis to the perfect restoration in Revelation, as you learn to recognize Jesus on every page.</p><p>Having read through the Bible using this format for nearly two decades, my love for Jesus Christ has deepened beyond words and my appreciation for His Word has grown exponentially. My desire is to share that with you. So let&#x2019;s begin!</p><p><br><b>January 1</b></p><p><b>In the Beginning</b></p><p>Today&#x2019;s Reading:<i> Genesis 1&#x2013;2</i></p><p><i>In the beginning God created.... And God said...&nbsp;</i>Genesis 1:1, 3</p><p>For those with eyes to see, Jesus&#x2019;s first appearance in the Bible is right here, at the very beginning. In the beginning God created. He created simply by speaking. God spoke and it was. In creation He revealed to us the power of His word and introduced us to His Son!</p><p>God said, &#x201c;Let us make man in our image&#x201d; (Gen. 1:26). Here we find the first reference to the Holy Trinity. Jesus is here in the &#x201c;us.&#x201d; Jesus, God the Son, who holds the creator rights, has been from the beginning (Prov. 8:22&#x2013;23; Isa. 43:13; Col. 1:17).</p><p>We can liken the Old Testament to a picture book that sketches out sweet shadows and presents powerful portraits of our Prince of Peace. We find Jesus revealed in its pages as the &#x201c;wisdom of God&#x201d; (1 Cor. 1:24), the &#x201c;redeemer&#x201d; (Job 19:25), &#x201c;Immanuel&#x201d; (Isa. 7:14), the &#x201c;righteous Branch&#x201d; of David (Jer. 23:5&#x2013;6), and the &#x201c;Prince of Peace&#x201d; (Isa. 9:6). But the New Testament reveals the image of the invisible God who became flesh and lived among us:</p><p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.... All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.... And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth. (John 1:1, 3, 14)</p><p>Jesus&#x2014;the Word made flesh, the creator, our lord and savior&#x2014;is here in Genesis. He is here from the very beginning!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>January 2</b></p><p><b>God&#x2019;s Remedy</b></p><p>Today&#x2019;s Reading: <i>Genesis 3</i></p><p><i>I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. </i>Genesis 3:15</p><p>Adam and Eve had everything anyone could ever dream of, but then they sinned. They rebelled against God. The Bible says that because of Adam&#x2019;s sin, all mankind was born into sin (Rom. 5:12). But God, who is rich in mercy, provided a remedy in the form of a redeemer who would take the punishment for sin&#x2014;the sin of the whole world. That redeemer is promised right here in Genesis 3:15.</p><p>Jesus Christ is the seed of Eve, the one who would crush the head of the serpent. Because of Christ&#x2019;s atoning work through His death and resurrection, we are no longer under the curse of sin but are instead children of God. We are joint heirs with Christ, and our Enemy has been defeated!</p><p>God saw Adam and Eve in their exposed state of sin and divinely provided them coverings from a sacrifice (Gen. 3:21). Those animal skins pointed to God&#x2019;s ultimate sacrifice, His promised remedy&#x2014;Jesus Christ.</p><p>God&#x2019;s grace covered Adam and Eve. This is good news for us, friend, because that same grace covers you and me. The blood of Jesus washes us clean. He covers our every sin, and we are clothed in Christ&#x2019;s righteousness (Rev. 19:8). So as you start a new day, no matter your situation, remember that God keeps His promises. He provided a redeemer who crushed the head of Satan, and that redeemer&#x2014;your redeemer&#x2014;lives! He is God&#x2019;s promised remedy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>January&nbsp;3</b></p><p><b>His Story Written in History</b></p><p>Today&#x2019;s Reading: <i>Genesis 4&#x2013;5</i></p><p><i>This is the document containing the family records of Adam.</i> Genesis 5:1, CSB</p><p>We serve a God who breathes life into the mundane. Today&#x2019;s reading is a great example. In Genesis 5 we find the first genealogy, listing the descendants of Adam. What appears to be an insignificant list of names becomes a masterpiece of intent and design when read through the lens of the gospel. Consider the Hebrew meaning of the names listed in Genesis 5:3&#x2013;29.</p><p><b>Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hebrew Meaning</b></p><p>Adam&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Man</i></p><p>Seth&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Appointed</i></p><p>Enos&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<i>Mortal</i></p><p>Cainan&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Possession </i>or <i>possesses</i></p><p>Mahalaleel&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Praise of God</i></p><p>Jared&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Descend </i>or <i>come down</i></p><p>Enoch&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Dedicated </i>or <i>to train</i></p><p>Methuselah&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Men </i>or <i>friends</i></p><p>Lamech&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Powerful</i></p><p>Noah&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Rest</i></p><p>And so it reads...</p><p>Man, although appointed mortal, through God&#x2019;s grace possesses the praise of God, who is His Son, Jesus Christ (2 Pet. 1:17; Col. 2:9; Matt. 3:17; Heb. 1:3; 2:9; John 14:7&#x2013;9; 17:24), who descended and came down.

Genesis 7:1</p><p>What a powerful picture of our salvation we find in the story of Noah&#x2019;s ark! God extended glorious grace to Noah by giving him a way to escape His righteous judgment on a wicked world. Noah, however, first had to pick up his hammer and do the job God called him to do.</p><p>Noah did according unto all that the Lord commanded him. (Gen. 7:5)</p><p>Later in the Bible we read of another carpenter who finished the work God gave Him to do. Our precious Jesus is the master carpenter who took the nails meant for us and built a bridge to redemption.</p><p>Having canceled out the certificate of debt consisting of decrees against us, which was hostile to us...He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross. (Col. 2:14, NASB)</p><p>By obeying God&#x2019;s plan and finishing the work God gave him, Noah escaped the judgment of the flood and was kept safe through the storm. Through Christ&#x2019;s obedience in finishing the work God gave Him, we, too, have escaped judgment.</p><p>So by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous. (Rom. 5:19)</p><p>Dear reader, as you pick up whatever &#x201c;hammer&#x201d; or tool the Lord has put in your hand today, be faithful and obedient to do the work God has called you to for His glory.

Genesis 11:4, ASV</p><p>In the Bible stones often signify God&#x2019;s unchanging truth (1 Cor. 10:4; Isa. 8:13&#x2013;14; Rom. 9:33; Matt. 7:24), whereas bricks often represent human effort. Bricks are crafted to replicate, replace, or provide an alternative to God&#x2019;s provision of stone, and therefore bricks represent a counterfeit.</p><p>The Tower of Babel provides a poignant look into our human nature and our propensity to build our own kingdoms using our own wisdom, ideas, and efforts, resulting in a false religion. We humans tend to prefer to chart our own course and map our own way, but if our plans are not God&#x2019;s plans, then we&#x2019;re building with bricks instead of stone.</p><p>Humanity&#x2019;s stubborn determination to do our own thing apart from God&#x2019;s will always leads to confusion, or as we see in today&#x2019;s reading, babbling. These people in Genesis 11 started out with what seemed to be a reasonable plan. But they ended up confused and scattered. Sin nearly always looks like a great idea at first, but it inevitably leads to a mess of confusion.</p><p>There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death. (Prov. 16:25, NKJV)</p><p>You and I are God&#x2019;s workmanship, living stones He is building up (1 Pet. 2:5). Rather than building with our own bricks for our own glory, let&#x2019;s determine today to yield to the work of the Holy Spirit, follow His plans, and walk in obedience to His Word.

There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.</i> Job 1:8, NIV</p><p>Since we&#x2019;re reading through the Bible in chronological order (the order in which the events happened), we&#x2019;re leaving Genesis to spend several days in Job, one of the most ancient books of the Bible. Biblical scholars believe that Job lived during the time of the patriarchs, specifically Isaac.</p><p>Job is presented as a man of outstanding character, a prominent figure renowned for his wisdom and wealth, blessed by God. But Job&#x2019;s world was undone in a moment&#x2019;s time. He lost his family, his health, and his wealth, and he was shunned by his friends before God stepped in and restored his life. Some would say the main lesson of Job is that God can bring good out of the worst of situations (Rom. 8:28).</p><p>But even sweeter than when pain turns to profit, burdens to blessings, or a trial to a testimony is when Jesus is revealed in the midst of the difficulties. That is the treasure found in the book of Job. This book holds profound revelations and shadows of Jesus.</p><p>In the first chapter, for example, God refers to Job as &#x201c;blameless and upright&#x201d; (v. 1, NKJV). Yet we know that none are righteous, that &#x201c;all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God&#x201d; (Rom. 3:10, 23, NKJV). Herein lies the glorious grace and mercy of our Lord. Just as He declared His servant Job blameless and upright, so, too, He declares that over you.</p><p>You can stand before God in full confidence that your sins are forgiven, you are clothed in Christ&#x2019;s righteousness, and the blood of Jesus cleanses every spot and blemish (1 John 1:9; Eph. 5:27). Like Job, you have found favor with God.</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p></p><h2>Family Child Care Record-Keeping Guide, Ninth Edition (Redleaf Business Series)</h2><p><p>For home-based family child care (daycare) providers, taking care of the children is only half of the job.

Modernist criticism tended to privilege form over matter&#x2015;considering material as the essentialized basis of medium specificity&#x2015;and technically based approaches in art history reinforced connoisseurship through the science of artistic materials. But in order to engage critically with the meaning, for example, of hair in David Hammons's installations, milk in the work of Dieter Roth, or latex in the sculptures of Eva Hesse, we need a very different set of methodological tools.</p><p>This anthology focuses on the moments when materials become willful actors and agents within artistic processes, entangling their audience in a web of connections. It investigates the role of materiality in art that attempts to expand notions of time, space, process, or participation. And it looks at the ways in which materials obstruct, disrupt, or interfere with social norms, emerging as impure formations and messy, unstable substances. It reexamines the notion of &#x201c;dematerialization&#x201d;; addresses materialist critiques of artistic production; surveys relationships between matter and bodies, from the hierarchies of gender to the abject and phobic; explores the vitality of substances; and addresses the concepts of intermateriality and transmateriality emerging in the hybrid zones of digital experimentation.</p><p><b>Artists surveyed include <br></b>Georges Ad�agbo, Carl Andre, Janine Antoni, Amy Balkin, Artur Barrio, Helen Chadwick, Mel Chin, Mark Dion, Jimmie Durham, Tessa Farmer, Chohreh Feyzdjou, Romuald Hazoum�, Pierre Huyghe, Ilya Kabakov, Mike Kelley, Anthony McCall, Teresa Margolles, Robert Morris, Michelangelo Pistoletto, Tino Sehgal, Shozo Shimamoto, Santiago Sierra, Robert Smithson, Simon Starling, Paul Thek, Paul Vanouse, Mierle Laderman Ukeles, Kara Walker</p><p><b>Writers include <br></b>Joseph D.

The book takes the reader from examinations of terms such as dematerialization and immateriality in the digital world to the hybrid context of inter- and transmateriality. What <i>Materiality </i>ultimately proposes is that we learn (again) to see material, that we listen to matter and that we let the substances that art is made of communicate their own agency.</p>&#x2015;<b>Jens Hoffmann</b>, Director, The Jewish Museum, New York<br><br><p>In <i>Materiality</i> Lange-Berndt has compiled a palimpsest of comment on waxiness, stickiness, smoothness and colour; of wood, mud, stone and sugar. Extracts from both theorists and artists combine to remind us of the elemental ways in which materials have formed art and art practice.

The author, political scientist Timothy Pachirat, was employed undercover for five months in a Great Plains slaughterhouse where 2,500 cattle were killed per day&#x2014;one every twelve seconds. Working in the cooler as a liver hanger, in the chutes as a cattle driver, and on the kill floor as a food-safety quality-control worker, Pachirat experienced firsthand the realities of the&nbsp;work of killing in modern society. He uses those experiences to explore not only the slaughter industry but also how, as a society, we facilitate violent labor and hide away that which is too repugnant to contemplate.</p><p>Through his vivid narrative and ethnographic approach, Pachirat brings to life massive, routine killing from the perspective of those who take part in it. He shows how surveillance and sequestration operate within the slaughterhouse and in its interactions with the community at large. He also considers how society is organized to distance and hide uncomfortable realities from view. With much to say about issues ranging from the sociology of violence and modern food production to animal rights and welfare, <i>Every Twelve Seconds</i>&nbsp;is an important and disturbing work.</p></p><p>A political scientist goes undercover in a modern industrial slaughterhouse to provide an account of killing work from the perspective of those who carry it out.

Heschel attempts to understand the thoughts, feelings, and impressions of each of the progphets, presenting the reader with a sense of their very being. He effectively achieves a balance between the objective supernatural and the subjective human situation, and presents a unique discussion of Amos, Hosea, Isaiah, Micah, Jeremiah, and Habakkuk and their particular challenges and journeys. The Prophets is both scholarly and devotional, an indispensable part of an in-depth understanding of the Old Testament.</p><p>According to the popular definition, a prophet is one who accurately predicts the future. But in the Jewish tradition, as Abraham Joshua Heschel explains in <i>The Prophets</i>, these figures earn their title by witnessing the world around them with outstanding passion. Prophets are those whose "life and soul are at stake" in what they say about "the mystery of [God's] relation to man." They are "some of the most disturbing people who have ever lived," and yet they are also "the men whose image is our refuge in distress, and whose voice and vision sustain our faith." Heschel's book, one of the classic texts on the subject, contains sophisticated, straightforward discussions of each of the Hebrew prophets, the primary themes of their preaching, and comparisons of Israel's prophets to those of other religions'. Throughout, Heschel avoids the two great temptations in any discussion of prophesy: overstating the supernatural quality of a prophet's epiphany ("A prophet is a person, not a microphone"), and reducing prophesy to a merely human phenomenon. Instead, Heschel describes the prophet's peculiar status as God's spokesman in a way that does justice to its complexity: "He speaks from the perspective of God as perceived from the perspective of his own situation." <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><p>Abraham J. Heschel (1907-1972), was perhaps the most significant Jewish theologian of the twentieth century. He was Professor of Jewish Ethics and Mysticism at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS) from 1946 until his death. In addition to The Prophets, his most influential works include "Man Is Not Alone: A Philosophy of Religion, God in Search of Man, Man's Quest for God: Studies in Prayer and Symbolism, Who Is Man?, The Insecurity of Freedom: Essays on Human Existence" and "The Sabbath: Its Meaning for Modern Man."</p></p><h2>Developmental Screening in Early Childhood: A Guide</h2><p>Sound developmental screening identifies those children who should receive more extensive assessment to determine whether they need additional support for learning.

She teaches courses in early childhood education and special education.It is extremely important that tests not be used to make highstakes decisions in early childhood programs. &#x201c;High-stakes&#x201d; tests are those directly linked to decisions regarding children&#x2019;s entry into a program or promotion or retention, that are used for evaluating or rewarding teachers or administrators, that affect the allocation of resources to programs, and that result in changes in the curriculum. Because children&#x2019;s development, and therefore their performance on any test, is so variable in their early childhood years, none of those &#x201c;high-stakes&#x201d; decisions should be based solely or primarily on test scores. Rather, tests should only provide supplementary information to help the teacher, parent, and other specialists arrive at the best possible decision for each child.</p><h2>The Impossible H L.

The sentimental novel of the previous generation, the Jacobin novel of William Godwin, the philosophical comedy of Robert Bage and Maria Edgeworth--all conveyed their own kind of ideological meaning. By recognizing Austen's relationship to the literature of ideas, Butler offers acute readings of each of the novels and an intellectual context in which to see them as a whole.<br></p><p>Marilyn Butler is at University of Cambridge.<br>"The work is stimulating and controversial.

Indeed, the late 19th century was a period of extreme poverty thinly veiled by fabulous wealth. However, we should not remember the era only for the strides made by steel magnate Andrew Carnegie or social reformer Jane Addams. All Americans had to adjust to the dynamic social and economic changes of the Gilded Age--the booming industries, growing cities, increased ethnic and cultural diversity. African American W. E. B. Du Bois, Native American Sitting Bull, and Chinese American Saum Song Bo spoke out against racial injustice. European immigrants Mary Antin and Robert Ferrari suffered the pitfalls and praised the opportunities found in their new country. Pioneer Phoebe Judson lamented the loneliness of making a life out West. And workers at Homestead Steel lost their lives in an attempt to improve labor conditions. Drawing from the letters, memoirs, newspaper articles, journals, and speeches of Gilded Age Americans, author Janette Greenwood arranges all of these voices to tell a story more vibrant and textured than the simple tale of robber baron versus starving poor. In addition to these voices, visuals--such as advertisements, maps, political cartoons, and a picture essay on Jacob Riiss urban photographs--create a kaleidoscopic view of the quarter century when diverse Americans struggled for the same goal: a better way of life, with more justice and democracy for each and all.<br> <br>Textbooks may interpret history, but the books in the <em>Pages from History</em> series are history. Each title, compiled and edited by a prominent historian, is a collection of primary sources relating to a particular topic of historical significance. Documentary evidence including news articles, government documents, memoirs, letters, diaries, fiction, photographs, and facsimiles allows history to speak for itself and turns every reader into a historian. Headnotes, extended captions, sidebars, and introductory essays provide the essential context that frames the documents. All the books are amply illustrated and each includes a documentary picture essay, chronology, further reading, source notes, and index.<br></p><p><br><strong>Janette Thomas Greenwood </strong>is Associate Professor and Chair of the History Department at Clark University. Her previous works include <em>Bittersweet Legacy: The Black and White "Better Classes" in Charlotte, N.C. 1850-1910</em> (UNC Press, 1994), <em>The Black Experience in Charlotte-Mecklenburg, 1850-1920: A</em> <em>Curriculum Guide for Teachers</em> (C-M Historic Properties Commission, 1984) and <em>On the Home Front: Charlotte During the Civil War</em> (Mint Museum of History, 1982).<br>Gr. 6-12. In a satirical novel that gave the Gilded Age its name, Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner depicted the post-Civil War years as rampantly prosperous, materialistic, and corrupt. But, as Greenwood shows in this multidimensional text, the period was actually as diverse as any time in U.S. history. Including a broad range of documents, which she defines as everything from diaries and editorial cartoons to mail-order catalogs and family photographs, she gives her book broad appeal. There's plenty to absorb and much to capture the imagination. Two-thirds of each spread is devoted to text that blends extensive author-driven information with excerpts from various documents. The remainder of the spread comprises quotations, photos, drawings, and brief articles that add dimension to the main narrative. Covering topics from immigration, farming, and labor to the West, women, and leisure, Greenwood presents the history as a seamless tapestry sewn by the people who lived it. <i>Roger Leslie</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Neil Armstrong responded by switching off the automatic mode and taking direct control. He stopped monitoring the computer and began flying the spacecraft, relying on skill to land it and earning praise for a triumph of human over machine. In <i>Digital Apollo</i>, engineer-historian David Mindell takes this famous moment as a starting point for an exploration of the relationship between humans and computers in the Apollo program. In each of the six Apollo landings, the astronaut in command seized control from the computer and landed with his hand on the stick. Mindell recounts the story of astronauts' desire to control their spacecraft in parallel with the history of the Apollo Guidance Computer. From the early days of aviation through the birth of spaceflight, test pilots and astronauts sought to be more than &#x201c;spam in a can&#x201d; despite the automatic controls, digital computers, and software developed by engineers.</p><p><i>Digital Apollo</i> examines the design and execution of each of the six Apollo moon landings, drawing on transcripts and data telemetry from the flights, astronaut interviews, and NASA's extensive archives. Mindell's exploration of how human pilots and automated systems worked together to achieve the ultimate in flight&#x2015;a lunar landing&#x2015;traces and reframes the debate over the future of humans and automation in space. The results have implications for any venture in which human roles seem threatened by automated systems, whether it is the work at our desktops or the future of exploration.</p></p><p>David A.

But most Indigenous activism remains unseen in the mainstream&#x2014;and so, of course, does its significance. J. Kehaulani Kauanui set out to change that with her radio program <i>Indigenous Politics</i>. Issue by issue, she interviewed people who talked candidly and in an engaging way about how settler colonialism depends on erasing Native peoples and about how Native peoples can and do resist. Collected here, these conversations speak with clear and compelling voices about a range of Indigenous politics that shape everyday life.</p><p>Land desecration, treaty rights, political status, cultural revitalization: these are among the themes taken up by a broad cross-section of interviewees from across the United States and from Canada, Mexico, Chile, Bolivia, Peru, Australia, and New Zealand. Some speak from the thick of political action, some from a historical perspective, others from the reaches of Indigenous culture near and far. Writers, like Comanche Paul Chaat Smith, author of <i>Everything You Know about Indians Is Wrong</i>, expand on their work&#x2014;about gaming and sovereignty, for example, or protecting Native graves, the reclamation of land, or the erasure of Indian identity. These conversations both inform and engage at a moment when their messages could not be more urgent.</p><p>Contributors: Jessie Little Doe Baird (Mashpee Wampanoag), Omar Barghouti, Lisa Brooks (Abenaki), Kathleen A.

Thinking about the ways in which economic policy, racism, and militarized policing combine to shape the city, <i>Lake&nbsp;Michigan</i>'s poems continue exploring the themes from Borzutzky's <i>Performance of Becoming Human</i>, winner of the National Book Award for Poetry. But while the influences in this book (C�saire, Vallejo, Neruda) are international, the focus here is local as the book takes a hard look at neoliberal urbanism in the historic city of Chicago.&nbsp; Named a 2018 Best Book of the Year by the New York Public Library.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p><b>Daniel Borzutzky</b> is a poet and translator, and the author of <i>The Performance of Becoming Human</i>, winner of the 2016 National Book Award for Poetry.

Composed in long, proselike lines, this work explicitly places itself in the tradition of protest poetry. Police brutality is a major theme, both as occasion for protest and enacted. . . . Authorities repeatedly attempt to normalize their brutality, claiming that this is "only war," that it is, "only the beginning of war."

This is our present nightmare cast as a rambling, sometimes droning dramatic monologue for countless voices that proclaim 'Investigator #41 ... / ... / ... asked me what I did on the internet' and admit, taking responsibility on everyone's behalf, "It's not enough to feel shame/ It's not enough to starve/ It's not enough to be dead when others are more dead."

Set in England's Northumberland countryside in the early 20th century, it takes up the story line from a previous book featuring Kate Hannigan and Kate's illegitimate daughter, Annie. Though Kate is now married to the wealthy and kind Dr. Rodney Prince, neither Kate nor Annie has forgotten their humble origins. Teenage Annie, in particular, is stung by accusations that her mother wasn't married when Annie was born. Then Terence Macbane, a slightly older local boy, returns home from Oxford. Ashamed of his own wrong-side-of-the-tracks upbringing, he finds himself strongly attracted to Annie despite her dubious past. But interference in the form of racy and determined Cathleen, Annie's perpetual rival, threatens to tear them apart. Will Annie be able to find the strength to overcome Cathleen? As a heroine, Annie's a bit too tearily immature, her musings more pathetic than sympathetic. Much more fun is bad-girl Cathleen, whose role as spoiler adds some spice to the treacle. Musings on Catholicism as solace embellish the tale, and lashings of melodrama heighten the suspense, although it tends to be of the "all's well that ends well" variety. Cookson wrote better, and more satisfying, novels. It would be a shame if she were remembered for such piffle. Agent, Sheila Land Associates. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p>Although Dame Catherine passed away in 1998, her posthumously published novels continue to entrance lovers of classic romance. Set in turn-of-the-century small-town England, this tale brings back Kate Hannigan, a strong-willed, formerly impoverished woman who shunned the Catholic Church, but the focus is on Annie, Kate's out-of-wedlock daughter, who has spent her life struggling with the cruel stigma of illegitimacy. She and her archenemy, Cathleen, represent traditional but not quite trite feminine roles. Annie is fair, naive, and virginal. Cathleen is dark-haired, cruel, and promiscuous and proves to be a formidable enemy, not just to Annie but to everyone Annie loves. Among her vicious misdeeds: sleeping with a beloved servant and then getting him fired, causing her brother to attempt suicide, leading her mother to a nervous collapse, and seducing the only man Annie will ever love, neighbor Terence Macbane. Annie wavers between entrusting her heart to Terence or serving God as a nun. Will Annie sacrifice earthly love, or will she find her way to forgiveness and her true calling as wife and mother? Cookson has crafted another evocative and alluring story animated by well-developed characters in this quintessential historical romance. <i>Deborah Rysso</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He wanted, he said, to achieve "an art that would kind of disappear&#x2015;that was supposed to not quite look like art." Light offered Nauman a medium both elusive and effervescent, but one that could also aggressively convey a message. Over the first three decades of his career, Nauman used the medium of light to explore the twists and turns of perception, logic, and meaning with the earnest playfulness that characterizes all his art. <i>Elusive Signs</i> focuses on the discrete body of Nauman's work that uses neon and fluorescent light in signs and room installations, and includes images of nearly all Nauman's work with light. After Window or Wall Sign, Nauman embarked on a series of neons that grappled with the semiotics of body and identity, and with My Name as Though it Were Written on the Surface of the Moon (1968), he forces the viewer to contemplate the role of naming in forming identity. Language&#x2015;signs and symbols&#x2015;plays an important role in Nauman's art. His later neon works emphasize the neon as a sign, presenting provocative twists of language and offering harsh and humorous sociopolitical commentary in such pieces as Run from Fear, Fun from Rear (1972). This series culminates in the monumental, billboard-size One Hundred Live and Die (1984), which employs overwhelming scale to bombard the viewer with sardonic aphorisms. In incisive essays that accompany the images of Nauman's work, Joseph Ketner II of the Milwaukee Art Museum (which originated the exhibit this book accompanies) and critics Janet Kraynak and Gregory Volk analyze the works in light both as a body of work and as an access point to Nauman's entire career.

Good money, world travel, and the chance to help rebuild a war-torn country sounded like the perfect job. Bolkovac was shipped out to Bosnia, where DynCorp had been contracted to support the UN peacekeeping mission. She was assigned as a human rights investigator, heading the gender affairs unit. The lack of proper training provided sounded the first alarm bell, but once she arrived in Sarajevo, she found out that things were a lot worse. At great risk to her personal safety, she began to unravel the ugly truth about officers involved in human trafficking and forced prostitution and their connections to private mercenary contractors, the UN, and the U.S. State Department. After bringing this evidence to light, Bolkovac was demoted, felt threatened with bodily harm, was fired, and ultimately forced to flee the country under cover of darkness&#x2015;bringing the incriminating documents with her. Thanks to the evidence she collected, she won a lawsuit against DynCorp, finally exposing them for what they had done. This is her story and the story of the women she helped achieve justice for.</p></p><p><p><b>Kathryn Bolkovac</b> is a former police investigator from Nebraska who served as an International Police Task Force human rights investigator in Bosnia.

But my superiors continuously tried to bury my cases. When I was promoted to UN Headquarters to oversee all cases of domestic abuse, sexual assault and human trafficking throughout Bosnia, my case files started disappearing on a routine basis from the Internal Affairs office. Files upon files of evidence we human rights officers, and even local Bosnian police, had collected never saw the light of day: victim statements, license plate numbers, identifying badges, names, tattoos, and even instant photographs.

But he doesn't stop there. <i>A Child's Garden of Verses</i>, written over a century ago, is filled to the brim with what are usually considered to be the first real poems written for children. This classic volume is an old friend to the generations of readers who were brought up on "I have a little shadow that goes in and out with me/ And what can be the use of him is more than I can see." In this perfectly lovely edition, the gossamer art of Jessie Willcox Smith (who first illustrated Stevenson's poems in the early years of the 20th century) is reproduced in all its charming glory. Black and white drawings throughout and eight full-page, warmly colorful paintings show beautiful, yet pleasantly imperfect children, busy at their daily activities--climbing trees, watching their reflections in a river, or sick in bed with an army of toy soldiers on guard. Place this on the shelf next to Mother Goose, Dr. Seuss, and Peter Rabbit. (All ages) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>First published in 1885, Stevenson&#39;s verses so truly reflect the feelings of young children--about being small, the bliss of going up in a swing so high, discovering one&#39;s shadow, happiness and sorrow and dreaming--that they have never ceased to be an essential part of a child&#39;s library. Robinson&#39;s beautiful pictures originally appeared in 1896 in the first illustrated edition.</p><h2>Fundamentals of Social Work Research</h2><p>Designed to help students develop skills in evaluating research and conducting studies, this brief version of Rafael J.

He emphasizes the destructive fragmentation of the working class along ethnic, political, and social lines, encouraged by the legacy of slavery, postslavery immigration, legal distinctions between various classes of labor, and the economic bases of the society. in contrast to the well-defined middle and upper classes, the working people appeared divided, disorganized, and leaderless.

Born of Russian Jewish parents in Lachine, Quebec in 1915, he was raised in Chicago. He received his Bachelor's degree from Northwestern University in 1937, with honors in sociology and anthropology, and did graduate work at the University of Wisconsin. During the Second World War he served in the Merchant Marines.<br><br>His first two novels,&nbsp;<b>Dangling Man</b>&nbsp;(1944) and&nbsp;<b>The Victim</b>&nbsp;(1947) are penetrating, Kafka-like psychological studies. In 1948 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship and spent two years in Paris and traveling in Europe, where he began his picaresque novel&nbsp;<b>The Adventures of Augie March</b>, which went on to win the National Book Award for fiction in 1954. His later books of fiction include&nbsp;<b>Seize the Day</b>&nbsp;(1956);&nbsp;<b>Henderson the Rain King</b>&nbsp;(1959);&nbsp;<b>Mosby's Memoirs and Other Stories</b>&nbsp;(1968);&nbsp;<b>Mr. Sammler's Planet</b>&nbsp;(1970);&nbsp;<b>Humboldt's Gift</b>&nbsp;(1975), which won the Pulitzer Prize;&nbsp;<b>The Dean's December</b>&nbsp;(1982);&nbsp;<b>More Die of Heartbreak</b>&nbsp;(1987);&nbsp;<b>Theft</b>&nbsp;(1988);&nbsp;<b>The Bellarosa Connection</b>&nbsp;(1989);<b>The Actual</b>&nbsp;(1996);&nbsp;<b>Ravelstein</b>&nbsp;(2000); and, most recently,&nbsp;<b>Collected Stories</b>(2001). Bellow has also produced a prolific amount of non-fiction, collected in&nbsp;<b>To Jerusalem and Back</b>, a personal and literary record of his sojourn in Israel during several months in 1975, and&nbsp;<b>It All Adds Up</b>, a collection of memoirs and essays.<br><br>Bellow's many awards include the International Literary Prize for&nbsp;<b>Herzog</b>, for which he became the first American to receive the prize; the Croix de Chevalier des Arts et Lettres, the highest literary distinction awarded by France to non-citizens; the B'nai B'rith Jewish Heritage Award for "excellence in Jewish Literature"; and America's Democratic Legacy Award of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, the first time this award has been made to a literary personage. In 1976 Bellow was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature "for the human understanding and subtle analysis of contemporary culture that are combined in his work."</p>"I think it A&nbsp;Work of Genius. I&nbsp;think it The Work of a Genius. I think it brilliant, splendid, etc. If there is literature (and this proves there is), this is where it's at." &#x2014; <b>John Cheever</b><br><br>"Bellow's incremental sound--or noise--rejects imitation the way the human immune system will reject foreign tissue.

A problem arises and people react, placing the emphasis on mechanics and fixed choices instead of on the objectives that give decisionmaking its meaning. In this book, Keeney shows how recognizing and articulating fundamental values can lead to the identification of decision opportunities and the creation of better alternatives. The intent is to be proactive and to select more attractive decisions to ponder before attempting any solutions.</p><p>Keeney describes specific procedures for articulating values by identifying and structuring objectives qualitatively, and he shows how to apply these procedures in various cases. He then explains how to quantify objectives using simple models of values. Such value analysis, Keeney demonstrates, can yield a full range of alternatives, thus converting decision problems into opportunities. This approach can be used to uncover hidden objectives, to direct the collection of information, to improve communication, to facilitate collective decisionmaking, and to guide strategic thinking. To illustrate these uses, Keeney shows how value-focused thinking works in many business contexts, such as designing an integrated circuit tester and managing a multibillion-dollar utility company; in government contexts, such as planning future NASA space missions and deciding how to transport nuclear waste to storage sites; and in personal contexts, such as choosing career moves and making wise health and safety decisions.</p><p>An incisive, applicable contribution to the art and science of decisionmaking, <i>Value-Focused Thinking</i> will be extremely useful to anyone from consultants and managers to systems analysts and students.</p></p><p>In this book, Ralph Keeney turns standard decisionmaking methods on their heads. Rather than placing emphasis on mechanics and fixed solutions, Keeney argues, we should focus on the bottom-line objectives that give decisionmaking its meaning: it is through recognizing and articulating fundamental values that we can better identify decision opportunities- and thereby create better decision alternatives.Ralph L. Keeney is a private consultant in San Francisco, as well as Professor of Systems Management, Institute of Safety and Systems Management, University of Southern California. He is coauthor (with Howard Raiffa) of Decisions with Multiple Objectives, which was awarded the Lanchester Prize of the Operations Research Society of America.</p><h2>Paul Henry</h2><p>The most important Irish landscape painter of the twentieth century, Paul Henry defined the quintessential view of the Irish landscape. In this lovely book S. B. Kennedy outlines Paul Henry&#x2019;s life and career, discusses how he is regarded today, and considers his role within the artistic heritage of Ireland. Detailed catalogue entries for each of the paintings reproduced in this volume reveal that Henry was more faithful in recording his subject matter than has been believed. Individual scenes can often be identified with precision, helping us to understand the artist&#x2019;s approach to picture making, his use of sketchbooks, and his attitude toward the landscape that so powerfully influenced him.</p><p>This book accompanies an exhibition to be held at the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin, from February 19 to May 18, 2003.In his idyllic landscape paintings of the west of Ireland, Paul Henry (1876-1958) provides the quintessential view of the Irish scene, now as universally familiar as C�zanne&#39;s view of Provence or Constable&#39;s recording of Suffolk. Henry stands alone as the most influential landscapist to work in Ireland in the twentieth century. In this generously illustrated biography, S. B. Kennedy tells the story of Henry&#39;s life and artistic achievements, interweaves the life of his highly talented wife Grace, and explores his friendships and associations in the artistic worlds of Paris, London, Dublin, and Belfast.Kennedy offers a full account of Henry&#39;s entire career, including his early experience studying under Whistler in fin-de-si�cle Paris, his subsequent work as an illustrator in London, and his transforming trip to Achill Island in his native Ireland in 1910. Transfixed by the landscape, the people of the island, and their way of life, Henry thereafter devoted his career to painting Irish life and landscape, introducing a degree of realism that was new to Irish painting. Kennedy also discusses the career of Henry&#39;s first wife, Grace (1868-1953), a painter in her own right who here emerges from behind the shadow of her husband as a more substantial figure than has been previously recognized. In addition, the author sets Henry&#39;s work in historical context and considers the reasons for renewed interest in Henry&#39;s landscape paintings in recent years.</p><h2>In the Nature of Materials: The Buildings of Frank Lloyd Wright 1887-1941 (Da Capo Paperback)</h2><p>This is the definitive study of Frank Lloyd Wright and his work, an eloquent summation of an outstanding career that spanned nearly seventy years of American architectural history. Writing with warmth and penetrating intelligence, Henry-Russell Hitchcock, America's leading architectural expert, explores Wright's distinctive approach to the design and construction of homes, civic centers, housing projects, country clubs, and office buildings&#x2014;emphasizing throughout Wright's skillful use of materials to create harmony between structure and environment.Hitchcock covers each of the major phases in Wright's first fifty years as an architect: the apprenticeship with J.L. Selsbee; the movement toward maturity with "Lieber Meister" Sullivan, and the links with Richardson, the "prairie" architecture of the early 1900s and the non-domestic work of the same period which exerted so great an influence upon the development of modern European architecture; the textile block housing and cantilevered skyscraper projects of the early &#x2018;20s; the creative hiatus of the late &#x2018;20s and early &#x2018;30s; and the projects of the Depression years, interrupted in 1942 by World War II.More than 400 illustrations are presented in chronological order in a format Wright himself designed, revealing an endless assortment of shapes, materials and structural ornament that indicate the scope and focus of Wright's genius. Accompanying the photographs, plans, and perspectives is Hitchcock's perceptive commentary, linking each building to a particular phase in Wright's development and showing how in each case the architect forged the elements of materials, mass, space, and ornament into a powerful visual statement.Hitchcock also contributes a list of the architect's completed projects through 1941, and, in a new foreword specially prepared for this Da Capo edition, assesses Wright's major projects during the last two decades of his life.</p><p></p><h2>Real Estate Valuation in Litigation, Second Edition</h2><p><i>Real Estate Valuation in Litigation</i>, second edition, provides appraisers and attorneys with a comprehensive overview of real estate law focusing on condemnation appraisal.

It is now a favorite with the critics and has attracted widely different styles of performance. At one extreme the play is seen as a religious allegory, at the other it has been interpreted as a comedy protesting against power and privilege. Brian Gibbons focuses on the unique tragi-comic experience of watching the play, the intensity and excitement offered by its dramatic rhythm, the reversals and surprises that shock the audience even to the end. The introduction describes the play&#39;s critical reception and stage history and how these have varied according to prevailing social, moral and religious issues, which were highly sensitive when</p><p>Like every other play in the Cambridge School Shakespeare series, Measure for Measure has been specially prepared to help all students in schools and colleges.

It invites you to bring the play to life in your classroom through enjoyable activities that will help increase your understanding. You are encourage to make up your own mind about the play, rather than have someone else&#39;s interpretation handed down to you.

Today&#x2019;s my official &#x201c;Independence Day,&#x201d; and let me tell you, it feels totally great! All right, Caitlin, let&#x2019;s settle down, girl.<br><br>Of course, I had hoped to sound much more mature when I started journaling in my first college diary (or maybe I should call it a journal now). After all, I might be<br>an aspiring writer, journalist, or who knows what? But honestly, I did want my first college entry to sound&#x2013;well, more grown-up.<br><br>On the other hand, a girl needs some place where she can just relax and be herself&#x2013;let her hair down, so to speak. Especially when I&#x2019;ve been acting so grown-up and mature for my parents lately, assuring them that I&#x2019;m really ready for this, that I&#x2019;ll be okay, and not to be so concerned&#x2013;you know the kind of stuff we tell our parents to get them to chill a little. But the bottom line is, I really do believe God is watching over me, so what&#x2019;s there to worry about?<br><br>And then, today&#x2013;the big move in. I had to keep reassuring my dad that I was perfectly fine with this new transition. I thought I had him pretty convinced too, until it was time for him to leave. Then, with a stricken look on his face, the next thing I know he&#x2019;s double-checking the dead bolt on my door and making sure the phone is working. Sheesh, he even tested the smoke detector and then actually grilled me about which was the quickest fire escape route, which fortunately I had noticed on about our fourth trip carrying my stuff up the stairs. (It&#x2019;s at the end of the hall to the right.)<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry so much, Dad,&#x201d; I told him. &#x201c;Hey, I even saw a fire extinguisher a couple doors down, and I&#x2019;ll bet it works just fine.&#x201d; I made a real effort not to laugh at what I know he feels is fairly serious business.<br><br>Finally we had all my boxes and bags and stuff stacked in my room, piled high and strewn all over the place like a tornado had blown in. (Dad believes that<br>haste makes waste...) Thankfully my roommate isn&#x2019;t here yet, so I might actually finish getting the last of my things put away before she arrives. I hadn&#x2019;t realized I&#x2019;d brought so much STUFF. In fact, I thought I was being somewhat of a minimalist. That is, until I saw all that crud heaped all over the room. As I suspected, Mom had thrown in a few extra items like an emergency food supply box, a first-aid kit, and even a mini medicine chest complete with Pepto-Bismol among other things! I guess she still doesn&#x2019;t think I can take care of myself, or<br>maybe she thinks that I&#x2019;m going to get ulcers here on my own. But I have to admit, it was sweet. And now that most of my stuff is stowed away, it doesn&#x2019;t look half bad around here.<br><br>Anyway, when it was time to go, my dad gave me this nice long hug, and then said all those typically parental things like: &#x201c;We really believe in you, Catie. We know you&#x2019;re going to do just great.&#x201d; Nice stuff like that. And I&#x2019;ll admit I cried, although I tried not to show it since I didn&#x2019;t want Dad to feel any worse than necessary. I cried a little more after he drove away. But as I walked back toward the dorm, it hit me. I felt this wonderful rush, this new excitement, almost like adrenaline pumping right through me. I&#x2019;m free! Independent! On my own! It felt so totally cool to realize this. It still does.<br><br>My mom had wanted me to join a sorority&#x2013;her old one to be specific. And despite my concern that it might not be a very Christian atmosphere, I actually looked into it (mostly to please Mom). Then I was informed that they had a mile-long waiting list. Still, I could&#x2019;ve gotten on the list if I&#x2019;d really wanted and if I was willing to go through rush week. Which I was NOT. I really don&#x2019;t care for the<br>idea of herding a bunch of girls around and trying to pick out the best among them. And the truth is, I think sororities are kind of shallow and superficial. Consequently, I liked the idea of a dorm better&#x2013;plus it seemed more independent.<br><br>I&#x2019;m sure I could be wrong about these things, but that&#x2019;s the general impression I got when I checked out my mom&#x2019;s old stomping grounds. I know my good buddy Josh belonged to a fraternity when he was here last year, and he thought it was great. But then it was a Christian organization. He&#x2019;d even encouraged me to look into a Christian sorority he knew about, but I figured if I wasn&#x2019;t going to join my mom&#x2019;s, I probably shouldn&#x2019;t try to join another. I mean, her feelings were already slightly hurt when I told her I wasn&#x2019;t interested. No need to rub it in. So here I am.<br><br>I already know my roommate&#x2019;s name is Elizabeth Banks and that she&#x2019;s a sophomore (since it says so on our door). But that&#x2019;s about all I know. I could have requested a specific roommate if I&#x2019;d known anyone coming to the university, which unfortunately I didn&#x2019;t.<br><br>Andrea LeMarsh thought she was going to come here, and we&#x2019;d talked about rooming together, but then she found out her dad had lost everything in the stock<br>market last spring. And even though her tightwad step dad has plenty of dough, he wouldn&#x2019;t spring for tuition plus room and board, so she decided to live at home and go to community college for a year. And, of course, Beanie and Jenny and Anna are all on their way to the Christian college even as I write. But here&#x2019;s the kicker: After all Mrs. Lambert put Jenny through last year, she actually let her take a car. I couldn&#x2019;t believe it&#x2013;that woman has really been changing lately!<br>Speaking of cars, my parents and I decided it was best to sell mine. I must admit to feeling a little blue at first, but I know it was the smart thing to do. There&#x2019;s no<br>way I could work to make payments plus car insurance and go to school full time. <br>Besides, everything&#x2019;s within walking distance here, and Dad even talked me into<br>bringing my bike, just in case. But I still miss that little car&#x2013;my first car. And it was a good car too. It took Jenny and Beanie and me (the three amigas) all the<br>way to Mexico and back! Now I have to finish unpacking, just in case the mysterious Elizabeth should arrive tonight and trip over my shoes still piled on the floor.<br><br>Wednesday, September 4<br>So far no roommate. But that&#x2019;s okay with me. It gives me a chance to sort of catch my breath and get my bearings. I&#x2019;m completely unpacked now, feeling almost at home with my familiar bedding and pillows and whatnot all around. I hope Elizabeth doesn&#x2019;t mind that I took the side of the room that&#x2019;s away from the door. I didn&#x2019;t really do it on purpose. I&#x2019;ve just always had my bed on the right and automatically took that side. Hopefully she won&#x2019;t care. And if she does, I&#x2019;ll offer to switch. Although that means moving everything and taking down my bulletin board and posters, which took me forever to arrange just right. Before Dad and I left town, Beanie Jacobs stopped by to say good-bye and to give me this cool poster with the Lord&#x2019;s Prayer on it. I hung it right where I can see it from my bed.<br><br>&#x201c;God bless you, Caitlin,&#x201d; Beanie said as she hugged me tightly. I could tell she was crying, which was making me cry too. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe we&#x2019;re going to be so far apart.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll e-mail,&#x201d; I promised, suddenly feeling the gulf that would soon separate us. &#x201c;We won&#x2019;t lose touch.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Right.&#x201d; She stepped back and wiped her nose. &#x201c;And Jenny says that if we miss you too badly, we&#x2019;ll just hop in her car and drive on over.&#x201d;<br><br>I forced a laugh. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s about three hundred miles, Beanie.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jenny drives fast.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, tell her to take it easy.&#x201d; Then I waved to Beanie as I climbed into Dad&#x2019;s SUV, wishing I&#x2019;d said something more meaningful, something profound and memorable. But I suppose that&#x2019;s kind of silly. I mean, it&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;m never going to see her again. In fact, I think I&#x2019;ll e-mail her tonight and see how their trip went.<br><br>I got an e-mail from Josh yesterday. He wrote to me as if he were personally welcoming me to the university(like he was still here). He invited me to attend his<br>fellowship group, told me the best place to get coffee, reminded me not to be late to registration (which is tomorrow, by the way), and then warned me that dorm<br>food usually stinks. I e-mailed back assuring him that I&#x2019;m fitting into things just fine, thank you very much. Not that I didn&#x2019;t want his advice, but it did come across as a little overbearing. And this is something we specifically discussed several times this summer.<br><br>You see, as much as I like Josh, he sometimes has this annoying habit of coming across as&#x2013;hmmm, how do I say this nicely&#x2013;acting slightly superior or perhaps even chauvinistic. Okay, maybe those aren&#x2019;t exactly the right words. I&#x2019;m not even sure how to describe it. But sometimes I almost feel as if he&#x2019;s telling me what to do or how to think. And I really don&#x2019;t appreciate it.<br><br>Now it&#x2019;s not that I don&#x2019;t respect or appreciate his wisdom, but it&#x2019;s more that I don&#x2019;t care for how he dishes it out sometimes. Of course, I never put it to him in quite<br>those words. But that&#x2019;s kind of how I felt, and for the sake of our friendship, I did try to communicate it to him. And I must give him this: He does listen. And he says he wants to change. I just think it&#x2019;s an old habit or something. His little sister Chloe said he&#x2019;s always been like that. She calls it &#x201c;just plain pigheaded,&#x201d; but I think that&#x2019;s a bit strong. Still, I&#x2019;m glad I can be honest with him and he doesn&#x2019;t get mad.<br><br>I guess that&#x2019;s one of the things I like about our friendship&#x2013;I feel free to tell him things that bother me, and he doesn&#x2019;t take offense. And I think our friendship<br>really grew this summer. Although to be honest, it made me a little uneasy to have him around so much. He was working in town, and as a result, it seemed as if we spent a fair amount of spare time together. Now, despite Jenny and Beanie&#x2019;s teasing, it wasn&#x2019;t a dating situation. Not really. I mean, both Josh and I had agreed from the get-go that we were not dating or romantically involved.<br>And to prove our point, we almost always had either my little brother Ben or Chloe or one or more of our other friends with us when we went anywhere. I know it sounds silly, but I also know it was for the best. And since this is a diary&#x2013;and a secret place&#x2013;I will say why I know this to be true.<br><br>You see, early in the summer, shortly after graduation, Josh stopped by our house one afternoon and just sort of hung out. He and Ben and I shot baskets for a while until it got too hot; then Ben went inside to get ready for a baseball game, and Josh and I decided to make an ice cream run. No big deal, right? We got double cones and then drove down by the lake just to talk and catch up and stuff. We walked out to the end of the dock, took off our shoes, dangled our feet in the water just like a couple of kids, and chatted away. But somehow, we started splashing each other with our feet. Just goofing around, it seemed.<br><br>But the next thing I knew, we&#x2019;re really going at it, kicking up water and screaming and laughing, and I thought I was actually getting the best of him. So then he grabbed me, and before I knew what hit me, we&#x2019;re both in the water, still laughing hysterically. And then we got quiet. I remember looking up at him and thinking<br>how, even sopping wet, he looked totally handsome with his dripping blond hair hanging into his eyes&#x2013;and maybe it was the lake, but his eyes seemed bluer than ever.<br>And suddenly&#x2013;I can&#x2019;t even remember exactly how it happened&#x2013;he kissed me! And I was TOTALLY kissing him back! Right there in the water. <br><br>Oh, man! Even as I write this, my face is burning with embarrassment and well, who knows what else? But I knew it was wrong. And he knew it was wrong. But the truth is, we didn&#x2019;t stop kissing right away. And when we did finally stop, there was just this dead silence. All we could hear was the lapping sound of the lake and crickets chirping. We climbed out of the water and both sat there stunned and humiliated, and I&#x2019;m sure a little breathless. I know I didn&#x2019;t know what to say, and I suppose I felt like it was all my fault somehow. I mean, hadn&#x2019;t I been the one to start splashing in the first place?<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he told me in a quiet voice.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry too,&#x201d; I echoed back, feeling slightly numb<br>inside.<br><br>&#x201c;Guess we better go now.&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded. Then we both stood and tried to shake off the water, which was drying fast thanks to the heat. Then we walked back to his Jeep without even speaking.<br><br>We didn&#x2019;t even talk as he drove me home. He apologized again at my house, and I just nodded and walked away, feeling like a total fool. What would Beanie and Jenny think if they knew? I wondered if I would ever tell them (as it turned out, I didn&#x2019;t). And even now that makes me feel like a hypocrite. But I immediately went up to my room and got down on my knees and prayed.<br><br>It had been more than a year since I first made my commitment to God not to date. And the main reason I made that promise was because of the way things had gone between Josh and me&#x2013;it&#x2019;s like we could never keep our hands off each other when we were going out.<br><br>So anyway, I told God I was really sorry and that I was wrong. I asked Him to forgive me, and I know that He did. But I must admit it took me a while to really forgive myself. Some people would think this is nothing, but to me it was something. I felt I&#x2019;d disappointed God&#x2013;and myself. Still, I reminded myself that I&#x2019;m human and God doesn&#x2019;t expect me to be perfect&#x2013;just to be changing daily and becoming more like Him. So I pretty much tried to forget about it. In fact, this is the first time I&#x2019;ve given it much thought since then.<br><br>Josh e-mailed me that same night, saying once again how sorry he was and how it would never happen again. He also promised to make sure we didn&#x2019;t set ourselves up for that kind of situation again.<br><br>But even now I am humbled to think how susceptible I was (and still am) to that sort of thing. To be perfectly honest, I think I had some sort of misplaced pride (like I was above falling into that kind of trap again), but God showed me differently&#x2013;I&#x2019;m simply human. And I think it was the same for Josh.<br><br>The good thing is, as summer progressed, we did avoid falling into that kind of temptation again. And I believe our friendship deepened and grew. As long as Josh wasn&#x2019;t telling me what to do (in that superior way he sometimes has), we got along fine. Even Chloe mentioned (just last week) how cool it was to see a guy and a girl who could be such good friends without being all romantically involved. I do plan to set her straight on some parts of that theory though&#x2013;without incriminating her brother, that is. I mean, it is possible for guys and girls to be &#x201c;just friends,&#x201d; but you have to keep a pretty close eye on things to succeed at it.

Ironically, the most decisive moment in this development may be when Betsy decides to leave her emotionally abusive and financially punishing husband; it is only after experiencing independence that she returns to her marriage and to what becomes her husbands deathbed. <em>Betsy Thoughtless</em> may be the first real novel of female development in English. In this edition the text is accompanied by appendices, including writings from the period that shed light on Haywood&#x2019;s life and work, and on her relationship with contemporaries such as Henry Fielding. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Christine Blouch</strong>, a professor in the Department of English at Bradley University, Illinois, has written widely on Haywood&#x2019;s life and works. </p><p> &#x201c;Both scholarly and readable, Christine Blouch&#x2019;s edition of Eliza Haywood&#x2019;s <em>The History of Miss Betsy Thoughtless</em> is a welcome addition to the expanding library of neglected and undervalued women novelists of the early eighteenth century that will contribute to the current re-assessment of Haywood&#x2019;s work.&#x201d; &#x2015; John Richetti, University of Pennsylvania </p> <p> &#x201c;Eliza Haywood transforms the familiar tale of the reformed coquette. A comic investigation of city morals and manners develops into a dark critique of women&#x2019;s vulnerability in bourgeois marriage. Christine Blouch&#x2019;s informative edition clarifies the contexts of Haywood&#x2019;s textual, political and personal relations.&#x201d; &#x2015; Ros Ballaster, Mansfield College, Oxford University </p> <p> &#x201c;Simply the best edition to date of Haywood&#x2019;s fiction.

It provides the tools to implement many statistical ideas that have been made possible by the widespread availability of workstations having good graphics and computational capabilities. This book is a guide to using S environments to perform statistical analyses and provides both an introduction to the use of S and a course in modern statistical methods. Implementations of S are available commercially in S-PLUS(R) workstations and as the Open Source R for a wide range of computer systems. The aim of this book is to show how to use S as a powerful and graphical data analysis system. Readers are assumed to have a basic grounding in statistics, and so the book is intended for would-be users of S-PLUS or R and both students and researchers using statistics. Throughout, the emphasis is on presenting practical problems and full analyses of real data sets. Many of the methods discussed are state of the art approaches to topics such as linear, nonlinear and smooth regression models, tree-based methods, multivariate analysis, pattern recognition, survival analysis, time series and spatial statistics. Throughout modern techniques such as robust methods, non-parametric smoothing and bootstrapping are used where appropriate. This fourth edition is intended for users of S-PLUS 6.0 or R 1.5.0 or later. A substantial change from the third edition is updating for the current versions of S-PLUS and adding coverage of R. The introductory material has been rewritten to emphasis the import, export and manipulation of data.

Meticulously elaborated by the editorial team of <em>Chiron Academic Press</em> in collaboration with the renowned literature publisher <em>Edition l'Aleph (l-aleph.com)</em>, this special edition, pays particular attention to the very authentic details of the editorial of text and images, fine type setting, <em>mise-en-page</em></i><em>, production, and print. The result is a revival of the vintage for the 21st century's reader. Thus a unique reading experience for the book lovers and collectors of this genre. A recommended edition to libraries.<br><br>Writing pseudonymously as "A Square", the book used the fictional two-dimensional world of Flatland to comment on the hierarchy of Victorian culture, but the novella's more enduring contribution is its examination of dimensions. The story describes a two-dimensional world occupied by geometric figures, whereof women are simple line-segments, while men are polygons with various numbers of sides. The narrator is a square, a member of the caste of gentlemen and professionals, who guides the readers through some of the implications of life in two dimensions. The Square dreams about a visit to a one-dimensional world (Lineland) inhabited by "lustrous points", and attempts to convince the realm's monarch of a second dimension; but is unable to do so. . .</em></p><p><i>Flatland</i> is one of the very few novels about math and philosophy that can appeal to almost any layperson. Published in 1880, this short fantasy takes us to a completely flat world of two physical dimensions where all the inhabitants are geometric shapes, and who think the planar world of length and width that they know is all there is. But one inhabitant discovers the existence of a third physical dimension, enabling him to finally grasp the concept of a fourth dimension. Watching our Flatland narrator, we begin to get an idea of the limitations of our own assumptions about reality, and we start to learn how to think about the confusing problem of higher dimensions. The book is also quite a funny satire on society and class distinctions of Victorian England.<p> <em>Flatland</em> (1884) is an influential mathematical fantasy that simultaneously provides an introduction to non-Euclidean geometry and a satire on the Victorian class structure, issues of science and faith, and the role of women. A classic of early science fiction, the novel takes place in a world of two dimensions where all the characters are geometric shapes. The narrator, A Square, is a na�ve, respectable citizen who is faced with proof of the existence of three dimensions when he is visited by a sphere and is forced to see the limitations of his world. </p> <p> The introduction to this Broadview Edition provides context for the book&#x2019;s references to Victorian culture and religion, mathematical history, and the history of philosophy. The appendices contain contemporary reviews; extracts from the work of fellow mathematical fantasy writer/mathematician Charles Hinton; Hermann von Helmboltz&#x2019;s &#x201c;The Axioms of Geometry&#x201d; (1870); and autobiographical passages from Abbott&#x2019;s <em>The Kernel and the Husk</em> (1886). </p></p><h2>The Space between Us: Exploring the Dimensions of Human Relationships</h2><p>Integrating psychological theories with empirical evidence, the author of this volume draws fundamental conclusions about the nature and types of relationships, and develops eight dimensions of relatedness ranging from the very casual to the deeply intimate.<p></p> <p></p> <p>Each chapter examines a particular dimension and includes a brief life history of a person interviewed by the author. Particular attention is paid to how the type of relationship discussed shaped that person, with diagrams charting these relationships over time. The book also discusses how the sexes differ in the way they relate to others and the various forms that love can take.</p></p><p>Based on interviews with men and women of all ages, Ruthellen Josselson explores the role of human relations in psychological development. She identifies what people need from each other, and how practitioners can help clients recognize, bear and direct their need for others. The Space Between Us presents a vocabulary for understanding human relationships, not in the traditional negative framework of depAndence and codepAndence, but in terms of the essential ways in which these connections make us whole.Presents a study of adult relatedness, not in the usual psychopathological framework of depAndence and codepAndence, but in terms of the dynamic and essential ways these connections make us whole.</p><h2>On Haiku</h2><p><p><strong>Everything you want to know about haiku written by one of the foremost experts in the field and the &#x201c;finest translator of contemporary Japanese poetry into American English&#x201d; (Gary Snyder)</strong></p><p>Who doesn&#x2019;t love haiku? It is not only America&#x2019;s most popular cultural import from Japan but also our most popular poetic form: instantly recognizable, more mobile than a sonnet, loved for its simplicity and compression, as well as its ease of composition. Haiku is an ancient literary form seemingly made for the Twittersphere&#x2015;Jack Kerouac and Langston Hughes wrote them, Ezra Pound and the Imagists were inspired by them, Hallmark&#x2019;s made millions off them, first-grade students across the country still learn to write them. But what really is a haiku? Where does the form originate? Who were the original Japanese poets who wrote them? And how has their work been translated into English over the years? The haiku form comes down to us today as a clich�: a three-line poem of 5-7-5 syllables. And yet its story is actually much more colorful and multifaceted. And of course to write a good one can be as difficult as writing a Homeric epic&#x2015;or it can materialize in an instant of epic inspiration.</p><p>In <em>On Haiku</em>, Hiroaki Sato explores the many styles and genres of haiku on both sides of the Pacific, from the classical haiku of Basho, Issa, and Zen monks, to modern haiku about swimsuits and atomic bombs, to the haiku of famous American writers such as J. D. Salinger and Allen Ginsburg. As if conversing over beers in your favorite pub, Sato explains everything you wanted to know about the haiku in this endearing and pleasurable book, destined to be a classic in the field.</p></p><p><strong>Hiroaki Sato</strong> was born of Japanese parents in Taiwan in 1942; his family fled back to Japan at the end of WWII, and in 1968 he moved to New York, where he has lived ever since. He is the translator of many volumes of Japanese poetry and literature. The president of the Haiku Society of America from 1979 to 1981, Sato received the America PEN translation prize and the Japan-U.S. Friendship Commission Translation Prize twice. He is the author of the books Legends of the Samurai, Snow in a Silver Bowl, and One Hundred Frogs, and from 2000 to 2017 wrote the monthly column &#x201c;View from New York&#x201d; for The Japan Times. New Directions also publishes his translation of The Iceland by Sakutaro Hagiwara.&#x201c;Sato's extraordinary collection of essays is at once a literary history, a scrupulous examination of the vicissitudes of translation, a discussion of haiku in America, and a series of introductions to lesser- known masters. Sato conveys encyclopedic knowledge in a lively, modest, occasionally self-deprecating tone, busting myths along the way.&nbsp; An expert illumination of a poetic form, to read and reread.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Autrey, <em>Booklist (starred)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This combination of history and criticism tells of the haiku, one of poetry&#x2019;s most simple and beloved forms.&nbsp;Sato gives a complete picture of the form&#x2019;s journey and significance.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>World Literature Today</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The pre-eminent translator of Japanese poetry in our time...possessed of an unfiltered enthusiasm and spontaneity.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>August Kleinzahler, <em>London Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Over the last four decades, English-speaking aficionados of modern Japanese literature have delighted in the numerous translations, both of prose and poetry, undertaken by the masterful hand of translator, essayist, and poet Hiroaki Sato.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Meera Viswanathan</strong></p><h2>40 Years of Evolution: Darwin&#39;s Finches on Daphne Major Island</h2><p><p><b>An important look at a groundbreaking forty-year study of Darwin's finches</b></p><p>Renowned evolutionary biologists Peter and Rosemary Grant have produced landmark studies of the Gal�pagos finches first made famous by Charles Darwin. In <i>How and Why Species Multiply</i>, they offered a complete evolutionary history of Darwin's finches since their origin almost three million years ago. Now, in their richly illustrated new book,<i> 40 Years of Evolution</i>, the authors turn their attention to events taking place on a contemporary scale. By continuously tracking finch populations over a period of four decades, they uncover the causes and consequences of significant events leading to evolutionary changes in species.</p><p>The authors used a vast and unparalleled range of ecological, behavioral, and genetic data&#x2015;including song recordings, DNA analyses, and feeding and breeding behavior&#x2015;to measure changes in finch populations on the small island of Daphne Major in the Gal�pagos archipelago. They find that natural selection happens repeatedly, that finches hybridize and exchange genes rarely, and that they compete for scarce food in times of drought, with the remarkable result that the finch populations today differ significantly in average beak size and shape from those of forty years ago. The authors' most spectacular discovery is the initiation and establishment of a new lineage that now behaves as a new species, differing from others in size, song, and other characteristics.

Between these two claims lies the largely unexplored region in which the European decadent movement turned into the modernist avant-garde. In this original historical study, Anderson explores Kafka's early dandyism, his interest in fashion, literary decadence and the "superficial" spectacle of modern urban life as well as his subsequent repudiation of these phenomena in forging a literary identity as the isolated, otherworldly "poet" of modern alienation. Rather than posit a break between these two personae, Anderson charts the historical continuities between the young Kafka and the author of <em>The Metamorphosis</em> and <em>The Trial</em>. The result is a startlingly unconventional portrait of Kafka and Prague at the turn of the century, involving such issues as Jungendstil aesthetics, Otto Weininger's "egoless" woman, the Viennese critique of architectural ornament, the clothing reform movement, anti-Semitism, and the question of Jewish-German writing.<br></p><p>Mark Anderson is translator and editor of In the Storm of the Roses: Selected Poems by Ingeborg Bachmann (Princeton UP, 1986), and editor of Reading Kafka: Prague, Politics and the Fin de Siecle, Schocken Books, NY, 1989.<br>"An innovative study of Kafka's search for literature, cogent and elegantly argued throughout."--<em>Choice</em><p></p><br>"A fascinating and insightful reading of Kafka, which places the Czech writer's attitude to the body, and his engagement with theories of body culture, art and adornment of his period, at the centre of his work."--<em>The Guardian</em><p></p><br>"Spritely, innovative, and provocative....It is a book about Kafka worth reading."--<em>London Times Saturday Review</em><p></p><br>"By focusing on Kafka's clothes as image and reality, Mark Anderson succeeds in a wholly original manner in penetrating the mysterious ether that seems to understand Kafka's literary corpus as disembodied from his life and times. Anderson's work restores Kafka to fin-de-siecle Austrian, and especially Viennese, cultural and intellectual life. The author has reconnected Kafka with his work, arguing persuasively that in Kafka's case, life and art are reciprocal spheres that illuminate each other. The historian will be particularly interested in and grateful for Anderson's accomplishment....If clothes helped define Kafka the man, then Anderson's book will help redefine the man in conjunction with his literature."--<em>Austrian History Yearbook</em><p></p><br>"It is Kafka's precarious position in this cultural environment that Mark Anderson reconstructs superbly in a well-researched and very readable study. The book is indispensable reading for Kafka scholars and highly recommendable to anyone interested in a renewal of historic criticism and cultural interpretation."--<em>The German Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Ancestral Passions: The Leakey Family and the Quest for Humankind&#39;s Beginnings</h2><p>An authoritative biography of the First Family of anthropology--Louis, Mary, and Richard Leakey--shows how they laid the foundations for what is known about the origins of man and reveals their jealousies and rivalries with one another. 30,000 first printing.</p><p>There is a pleasing irony that a single family--the Leakeys--has been one of the most important and effective forces in the age-old effort to trace the <i>human</i> family to its origins. Virginia Morell's book is a fascinating and authoritative personal and scientific biography of the real family (comprised of Louis, Mary, and Richard Leakey), their scientific progeny, and (again in a fitting touch of irony), the competing bands of modern anthropologists competing over limited paleontological and conceptual resources of publication, prestige, and power, much like ancient hominid bands competing for caves, copulations, and carcasses.

About 7,000 people from the San Francisco Bay Area&#x2014;the vast majority of whom were American citizens&#x2014;were moved to an assembly center at Tanforan Racetrack and then to a concentration camp in Topaz, Utah. Dubbed the "jewel of the desert," the camp remained in operation until October 1945. This compelling book tells the history of Japanese Americans of San Francisco and the Bay Area, and of their experiences of relocation and internment.<br><br>Sandra C. Taylor first examines the lives of the Japanese Americans who settled in and around San Francisco near the end of the nineteenth century. As their numbers grew, so, too, did their sense of community. They were a people bound together not only by common values, history, and institutions, but also by their shared status as outsiders. Taylor looks particularly at how Japanese Americans kept their sense of community and self-worth alive in spite of the upheavals of internment.<br><br>The author draws on interviews with fifty former Topaz residents, and on the archives of the War Relocation Authority and newspaper reports, to show how relocation and its aftermath shaped the lives of these Japanese Americans. Written at a time when the United States once again regards Japan as a threat, Taylor's study testifies to the ongoing effects of prejudice toward Americans whose face is also the face of "the enemy."</p><p><b>Sandra C. Taylor</b> is Professor of History at the University of Utah. She is the author of <i>Advocate of Understanding: Sidney L. Gulick and the Search for Peace with Japan</i> (1984) and the co-editor of <i>Japanese Americans: From Relocation to Redress</i> (1986).Utah history professor Taylor explores the impact on the issei and nissei of the San Francisco Bay area of their World War II journey from their homes to their assembly at Tanforan Racetrack and then their internment at the Topaz, Utah, camp. Taylor finds "community" to be a vital concept in her analysis of the "network of associations and institutions that held together a group of people who were set apart from the majority by their ethnicity" before the war and of the effects of internment on that network and on the people who had been part of it. Drawing on the records of the War Relocation Authority, the contemporary press, other studies of those American concentration camps, and nearly 50 oral histories of area Japanese Americans who were interned at Topaz, <i>Jewel of the Desert</i> is a thoughtful, nuanced narrative of the Utah internment.

Oakley Hall, in his very fine novel Warlock has restored to the myth of Tombstone its full, mortal, blooded humanity . . . . It is the deep sensitivity to abysses that makes Warlock one of our best American novels. For we are a nation that can, many of us, toss with all aplomb our candy wrapper into the Grand Canyon itself, snap a color shot and drive away; and we need voices like Oakley Hall&#x2019;s to remind us how far that piece of paper, still fluttering brightly behind us, has to fall." &#x2014;Thomas Pynchon, HolidayOakley Hall was born in 1920 in San Diego and grew up there and in Honolulu, where his mother moved after his parents&#x2019; divorce.

Gray writes about his experiences flying combat sorties from the deck of an aircraft carrier during one of the most intense periods of aerial combat in U.S. history. From the perspective of a junior naval aviator, Gray reveals the lessons he learned first at the Naval Aviation Training Command and then in actual combat flying the Skyhawk from USS <i>Bon Homme Richard</i> in Vietnam. Training strengthens commitment, Gray points out, allowing ordinary men like him to fly dangerous missions. Readers will discover how circumstances created heroe--heroes who managed to overcome their personal fears for a greater cause--and how, despite the lack of public support for the war, the men remained committed to one another. The book addresses how men react to service during contentious political times to offer lessons relevant today.</p><p>Stephen R. Gray became a flight instructor at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Beeville, Texas, after his aerial combat service in Vietnam. He left the Navy in 1972 and flew commercially for Delta Airlines for thirty years, logging more than twenty-four thousand flying hours. He lives in Hemphill, Texas."In this engaging memoir, Stephen Gray shows us what it was like to be a naval aviator during the turbulent sixties, from training as a NAVCAD to flying combat missions off the deck of Bon Homme Richard as an A-4 pilot in VA-212 during an initial tour in Southeast Asia.

Several of the shorter papers have not previously been published, notably Edwards&#x2019; letter on the "flying" spider (hither known only in a draft version), an essay on light rays, and a brief but important set of philosophical notes written near the end of his life. Wherever possible the works have been newly transcribed from manuscript originals. Wallace Anderson has collected, edited, and presented them here in a thoroughly authentic and readable text. <br>Each of the major works in this volume and each group of related writings are preceded by detailed discussion of manuscript sources and dates. In his introduction Anderson makes these the basis for a revised account of the chronology of Edwards&#x2019; early writings and a deeper investigation of their biographical and historical context. Also included in the introduction are a new appraisal of Edwards&#x2019; efforts and achievements in science and an analysis of the developmental of his philosophical views. Anderson concludes from his research that Edwards was an enthusiastic, though untrained, investigator in the Newtonian tradition and that he grappled with the major metaphysical problems raised by this tradition. The papers reveal with special clarity the fertile and inquiring mind of our leading eighteenth-century philosopher-theologian. <br><i>Wallace E.

By understanding the physical basis of how instruments are used to make music, one hopes ultimately to be able to give physical criteria to distinguish a fine instrument from a mediocre one. At that point science may be able to come to the aid of art in improving the design and performance of musical instruments. As yet, many of the subtleties in musical sounds of which instrument makers and musicians are aware remain beyond the reach of modern acoustic measurements. This book describes the results of such acoustical investigations - fascinating intellectual and practical exercises. Addressed to readers with a reasonable grasp of physics who are not put off by a little mathematics, this book discusses most of the traditional instruments currently in use in Western music. A guide for all who have an interest in music and how it is produced, as well as serving as a comprehensive reference for those undertaking research in the field.</p><p>"Essentially everything you have ever wanted to know about the physics of musical instruments" PHYSICS TODAY <br>"a rigor, graphical detail, and verbal description."

Their true and terrible stories are included in <i>Troopers with Custer</i>. Some of the veterans who corresponded with E. A.

Developed for students, educators, supervisors, and practitioners alike, this text examines the significant classical and contemporary issues in marriage and family therapy. The text opens with a thoughtful discussion of client and therapist worldviews, value sensitive care, the ecology of therapy, and commonalities between personal and professional acculturation. Following the book&#x2019;s preliminary discussion, the text moves on to consider the legal, ethical, and professional issues that marriage and family therapists face each day as well as the best strategies for navigating these issues.

In addition, a completely new chapter explores contemporary ethical issues for which no formal precedent has yet been established. With its practical focus and planned, concise coverage, the book ensures students to gain both a theoretical background and an applications orientation. In each of the three major sections, chapters address &#34;general&#34; issues, as well as issues specific to marriage and family therapy. A concluding chapter in each section offers case illustrations that expand upon the material covered in the previous chapter. This two-step presentation helps students attain a greater understanding of how information is used in actual practice...and helps them more effectively internalize instruction.Preface <p> Although less than 100 years old, professional psychotherapy has become a major influence in society. Therapists contribute to and considerably affect many aspects of modern life. During this time, psychotherapy has broadened its perspective. No longer is it practiced exclusively on a one-therapist-to-one-client basis. Group therapy efforts have become commonplace in almost every mental health setting. Likewise, the last several decades have seen the advent of another expansion within the psychotherapeutic field, that of marriage and family therapy. </p><p> Many therapists have replaced or supplemented their traditional individual and group models of practice with one emphasizing couples and families as the dominant treatment focus. This is not to suggest that contact with marital partners and other family members had been completely ignored. Rather, marital partners and family members had always been considered in light of the individual client's concerns and from an individually oriented therapeutic perspective. </p><p> As the practice of marriage and family therapy has evolved, training procedures have become more explicit, replicable, and accessible. Specific theories and techniques have been identified. Broad curricular components for training have been compiled. And specific content, goals, and teaching methods for university coursework and professional workshops have been delineated. These materials and strategies all continue to be researched, evaluated, and enhanced. Noticeably lacking before the publication of the first edition of Ethical, Legal, and Professional Issues in the Practice of Marriage and Family Therapy, however, were sources addressing "nontherapy" issues necessary to supplement the therapeutic training of marriage and family therapists (Piercy &amp; Sprenkle, 1983). </p><p> The importance of these nontherapy issues was emphasized in an article entitled "Family Therapy May Be Dangerous for Your Health" (Hare-Mustin, 1980), in which the author states: </p><p> In sum, family therapy may not be in the best interests of individual family members.<br> Family therapists and their clients need to be aware of possible risks to the rights of<br> the individual member. By being required to participate, individuals may have to<br> subordinate their own goals and give up limited confidentiality and privacy. In addition,<br> therapists who idealize the traditional family may foster stereotyped roles and expectations<br> in the family that disadvantage individuals and limit their well-being and mental health. (p. 938)</p><p></p><p> Although offerings in the professional literature and training opportunities at conferences and workshops have increased in both number and quality, nontherapy issues&#x2014;particularly ethical, legal, and associated professional concerns&#x2014;are still underrepresented in relation to their potential impact on the practice of many mental health professionals. The simple fact that marriage and family therapy differs from individual and group therapy on both conceptual and pragmatic levels requires that therapists be adequately prepared to handle controversial issues from a marriage and family perspective as well. Questions that are difficult in individual and group therapy can become significantly more complicated when a couple or whole family presents itself for services (Margolin, 1982). </p><p> The American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, the professional organization with which most marriage and family therapists are primarily affiliated, specifies graduate-level coursework in "professional studies" as a requirement within its educational requirements for clinical membership. In response, courses in "ethical, legal, and professional issues" have been developed and constitute a core component of marriage and family training programs. The first and second editions of Ethical, Legal, and Professional Issues in the Practice of Marriage and Family Therapy served as a basic text for these courses as well as a primary source for practicing professionals seeking to expand their knowledge of ethical, legal, and professional issues in marriage and family therapy. ORGANIZATION OF THE TEXT </p><p> This third edition has been updated and expanded so that it may continue to serve as a basic resource for both beginning students and practicing professionals. It is divided into three parts. Part 1 addresses ethical issues in marriage and family therapy. Chapter 1 examines major ethical issues confronting all therapists, particularly the beginning marriage and family therapist and the experienced practitioner who is shifting from an individual approach to a marriage and family perspective. Chapter 2 discusses ethical issues inherent in the interactive nature of marriage and family therapy. Chapter 3 presents contemporary ethical issues for which there is little precedent; positions advocated in the professional literature and recommendations made for handling these issues are reviewed. Chapter 4 offers a "casebook" of examples with critiques highlighting the AAMFT Code of Ethics (American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, 1998). Part 2 considers legal issues in marriage and family therapy. Chapter 5 investigates the roles and relationships of marriage and family therapists within the legal system. Chapter 6 examines relevant family law. Chapter 7, like Chapter 4, is a casebook of examples with critiques discussing the impact of legal issues on marriage and family therapy. Part 3 focuses on professional issues. Chapter 8 discusses "valuing" and the professional practice of marriage and family therapy. Chapter 9 explores the professional identity of a marriage and family therapist. Chapter 10 offers another casebook of examples addressing professional questions. </p><p> Special attention should be paid to the three casebook chapters: 4, 7, and 10. We recall our days as clinicians-in-training seeking to fathom those notions we garnered from our readings. Classroom instructors and clinical supervisors, knowledgeable and skilled from years of experience, provided case examples to illustrate the concepts more clearly. Those illustrations made learning a more concrete experience, from which we emerged much better prepared. </p><p> Overall, this book seeks to encourage a greater familiarization and expansion of knowledge relevant to ethical, legal, and professional issues necessary to supplement clinical training and practice in marriage and family therapy We hope that you will gain an introduction to some of the issues you may encounter and that you will be stimulated to think about your own position as a marriage and family therapist, whether as a primary source of professional identity or professional specialization. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS </p><p> So many persons have contributed, both directly and indirectly, to our personal and professional development and to the writing of this book that it is impossible to thank them all. We thank the majority of them as a group by offering this book as a contribution of social interest that will, we hope, enhance the lives of mental health professionals and the clients with whom they interact. A few individuals, however, need to be singled out for special thanks. </p><p> Lee Baruth coauthored the first edition of this book. Without his many contributions, this work would not have been possible. For their constructive suggestions during the preparation of the manuscript, we thank reviewers Robert Barrett, University of North Carolina-Charlotte; Sarah G. Gabbay, Colorado State University; Lizbeth Ann Gray, Oregon State University; and Michael Poison, East Carolina University. We are particularly indebted to Kevin Davis, the executive editor for this project at Merrill/Prentice Hall. </p><p> Finally, we thank those who have made personal contributions to our lives. From Sam Gladding: "I am indebted to my parents, Russell and Gertrude, for their attention to teaching me the importance of values at a young age. My wife, Claire, and our children, Ben, Nate, and Tim, have been both understanding and supportive during my times of writing for this book. A family's encouragement and company cannot be valued enough." From Ted Remley: "I want to thank my parents, TE and Era, for giving me the education necessary to write books. I also appreciate my extended family, close friends, colleagues, and graduate students for tolerating my absences when I write and my crabby disposition when I am trying to make deadlines." And from Charles Huber: "I thank my parents, Charles and Helen, for modeling for me those core ethical qualities I had only to label, not learn, when I began my professional training and later entered clinical practice. My partner, Betsy, and our children, David and Morgan, have been most patient during the writing of the revision." </p><p> Samuel T Gladding, Ph. D.<br> Theodore E Remley, Jr., Ph.D.<br> Charles H.

Discovered again after eighty years of silence, Bulgakov&#x2019;s work speaks with remarkable directness to the postmodern listener. This outstanding translation of <i>Philosophy of Economy </i>brings<i> </i>to English-language speakers for the first time a major work of social theory written by a critical figure in the Russian tradition of liberal thought.<br><br>What is unique about Bulgakov, Catherine Evtuhov explains in her introduction to this book, is that he bridges two worlds. His social thought is firmly based in the Western tradition, yet some of his ideas reflect a specifically Russian way of thinking about society. Though arguing strenuously in favor of political and social liberty, Bulgakov repudiates the individualistic basis of Western liberalism in favor of a conception of human dignity that is compatible with collectivity. His economic theory stresses the spiritual content of life in the world and imagines national life as a kind of giant household. Bulgakov&#x2019;s work, with its singularly postmodern balance between Western and non-Western, offers fascinating implications for those in the process of reevaluating ideologies in post-Soviet Russia and in America as well.<br><br></p><p><b>Catherine Evtuhov</b> is associate professor of history at Georgetown University.<br>&#34;Evtuhov&#39;s translation reveals a sympathetic understanding of Bulgakov&#39;s patterns of thought and his philosophical assumptions. It is an informed translation.&#34;-Maria Carlson, University of Kansas</p><h2>Organizations,</h2><p>This book provides the original and definitive treatments of such fundamental concepts as bounded rationality, attention focus, and problem solving.</p><p></p><h2>Elementary Algebra</h2><p>Designed for first-year developmental math students who need support in beginning algebra, Elementary Algebra, 4/e, retains the hallmark features for which the Larson team is known: abundant, high-quality applications; the use of real data; the integration of visualization (figures and graphs) throughout; and extensive opportunities for self-assessment (mid-chapter quizzes, review exercises, tests, and cumulative tests).

Bush, Americans have long sought to integrate faith with politics. Few have been as successful as Hollywood evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson. </p><p> During the years between the two world wars, McPherson was the most flamboyant and controversial minister in the United States. She built an enormously successful and innovative megachurch, established a mass media empire, and produced spellbinding theatrical sermons that rivaled Tinseltown's spectacular shows. As McPherson's power grew, she moved beyond religion into the realm of politics, launching a national crusade to fight the teaching of evolution in the schools, defend Prohibition, and resurrect what she believed was the United States' Christian heritage. Convinced that the antichrist was working to destroy the nation's Protestant foundations, she and her allies saw themselves as a besieged minority called by God to join the "old time religion" to American patriotism. </p><p> Matthew Sutton's definitive study of Aimee Semple McPherson reveals the woman, most often remembered as the hypocritical vamp in Sinclair Lewis's <i>Elmer Gantry</i>, as a trail-blazing pioneer. Her life marked the beginning of Pentecostalism's advance from the margins of Protestantism to the mainstream of American culture. Indeed, from her location in Hollywood, McPherson's integration of politics with faith set precedents for the religious right, while her celebrity status, use of spectacle, and mass media savvy came to define modern evangelicalism. </p></p><p>Matthew Avery Sutton is Associate Professor of History at the College of Liberal Arts, Washington State University.Matthew Sutton's <i>Aimee Semple McPherson</i> may be the best single book yet published on this icon of early twentieth-century American religion and culture. Beautifully paced and superbly researched, the book weaves McPherson's inherently fascinating and ultimately tragic career into larger stories about California, pentecostalism, and emerging popular culture. Empathetic, critical, and insightful simultaneously, Sutton has produced a compellingly narrated book about one of modern America's most magnetic women.<br> --Jon Butler, author of <i>Becoming America: The Revolution before 1776</i><br><br>At long last, a biographical exploration of Aimee Semple McPherson that steers clear of stereotype, caricature, and condescension. Matthew Sutton deftly addresses Sister Aimee's fame and her legacy in his fine biography, but he does so with care and attention to her humanity as well.<br> --William Deverell, University of Southern California<br><br>Aimee Semple McPherson passionately embraced her role as a religious celebrity in an increasingly mass media-oriented age and steadfastly refused to be constrained by traditional notions of gender or sexuality. Americans of the 1920s and 1930s were fascinated by her, and readers today will feel the same way, thanks to Matthew Avery Sutton's timely and absorbing biography.<br> --Susan Ware, editor of <i>Notable American Women: Completing the Twentieth Century</i><br><br>Not content to see Aimee Semple McPherson--"Sister"--simply as a woman evangelist, or even as a religious icon, Matthew Sutton places her career in a wide range of contexts, including gender, media, Southern California popular culture, and the muscular expansion of American evangelicalism. This is terrific history, reflecting meticulous research, persuasive argumentation, and a writing style as vibrant as the story it tells.<br> --Grant Wacker, author of <i>Heaven Below: Early Pentecostals and American Culture</i><br><br>In the page-turning book, <i>Aimee Semple McPherson and the Resurrection of Christian America</i>, Matthew Avery Sutton makes a persuasive case that the Canadian evangelist was responsible for rescuing conservative Protestantism from obscurity while creating the political model for today's powerful Religious Right. She promoted the now-widely held conviction that Jesus Christ and the 'American way of life' are synonymous. Other books have been written about McPherson, but Sutton's goes furthest in making the important argument that the Canadian evangelist was the most influential model for the merging of conservative Christian identity and American patriotism...At the time of the 1925 Scopes 'monkey trial' over the teaching of evolution, McPherson organized a giant parade and theatrical stage play at her baroque Angelus Temple that portrayed what she called the 'hanging and burial of monkey teachers.' Eighty years later, McPherson's brand of evangelical sensationalism is again spiking up the issue of whether to teach evolution in U.S. public schools, while in most other industrialized countries the dispute barely registers...Sutton's book deserves special praise for its socio-political analysis--for outlining Sister Aimee's pivotal role in giving birth to today's politicized evangelical Christianity.<br> --Douglas Todd (<i>Vancouver Sun</i> 2007-02-17)<br><br>Sutton helps readers see in McPherson more than one paradoxical woman: her Foursquare Gospel helped catalyze a fundamental cultural realignment that brought Pentecostals and Evangelicals into the American mainstream, transforming American politics in ways that continue to write today's headlines. A nuanced portrait of an entire movement.<br> --Bryce Christensen (<i>Booklist</i> 2007-04-01)<br><br>[Sutton] reminds us that Aimee Semple McPherson 'exemplified evangelicalism's appeal to millions of Americans' and suggests that it is time to re-examine her life and legacy.<br> --Bryan F.

The world's worst problems--terrorism, drugs and human trafficking, absolute poverty, ethnic conflict, disease, genocide--originate in such states, and the international community has devoted billions of dollars to solving the problem. Yet by and large the effort has not succeeded. <br><br>Ashraf Ghani and Clare Lockhart have taken an active part in the effort to save failed states for many years, serving as World Bank officials, as advisers to the UN, and as high-level participants in the new government of Afghanistan. In <em>Fixing Failed States</em>, they describe the issue--vividly and convincingly--offering an on-the-ground picture of why past efforts have not worked and advancing a groundbreaking new solution to this most pressing of global crises. For the paperback edition, they have added a new preface that addresses the continuing crisis in light of ongoing governance problems in weak states like Afghanistan and the global financial recession. As they explain, many of these countries already have the resources they need, if only we knew how to connect them to global knowledge and put them to work in the right way. Their state-building strategy, which assigns responsibility equally among the international community, national leaders, and citizens, maps out a clear path to political and economic stability. The authors provide a practical framework for achieving these ends, supporting their case with first-hand examples of struggling territories such as Afghanistan, Sudan, Kosovo and Nepal as well as the world's success stories--Singapore, Ireland, and even the American South.<br></p><p><br><strong>Ashraf Ghani</strong> played a central role in the design and implementation of the post-Taliban settlement in Afghanistan, serving as UN adviser to the Bonn process and as Finance Minister during Afghanistan's Transitional Administration. He has worked at the World Bank and taught at Johns Hopkins and Berkeley universities. He has been nominated for the job of Secretary General of the United Nations and considered for the job of President of the World Bank. He chairs the Institute for State Effectiveness.<br><br><strong>Clare Lockhart</strong> is co-founder and director of the Institute for State Effectiveness, established in 2007 to advise leaders on transformation of countries from instability to stability. From 2001 to 2005, she lived and worked in Afghanistan, first as a member of the UN negotiation team and then advising the Afghan Government, leading design of several national initiatives. She now advises leaders on a range of countries across Asia, Africa and the Americas. She was educated at Oxford, Harvard and is a member of the Bar of England and Wales.<br><br>"Clear, taut language makes it accessible at almost any level of education...a roadmap to a groundbreaking new solution to this most pressing of global crises."--United Press International<p></p><br>"Ashraf Ghani is a practitioner turned theoretician. Drawing on his background at the World Bank and as the first post-Taliban finance minister of Afghanistan, he together with Clare Lockhart develops a comprehensive framework for understanding the problem of state-building. He argues persuasively that this will be the central challenge underpinning world order in our globalized age, and offers practical solutions for meeting it."--Francis Fukuyama, author of <em>State-Building: Governance and World Order in the 21st Century</em><p></p><br>"This book is an important and timely alarm bell for the world's next crisis-and proves that no one knows more about how states function (and don't) than Ghani and Lockhart. We ignore their remedies at our peril."--Hernando de Soto, author of <em>The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the</em> <em>West and Fails Everywhere Else</em><p></p><br>"<em>Fixing Failed States</em> provides a brilliantly crafted and extraordinarily valuable analysis of what makes states fail and what makes them succeed. Everyone concerned about improved governance-and particularly public officials at all levels in industrialized, emerging and developing nations alike-will benefit enormously from reading this and studying the great insights it provides."--Robert Hormats, Vice Chairman of Goldman Sachs (International)<p></p><br>"Ashraf Ghani and Clare Lockhart have filled a critical gap in our understanding of development, security and state-building. By combining an insightful analysis of weak and failed states with a clear-eyed proposal rooted in practical experience, the authors provide the international community with both a better understanding of the challenges we face and a solution."--Gayle Smith, Senior Fellow at the Center for American Progress and former Senior Director for African Affairs at the National Security Council<p></p><br>"Ashraf Ghani has held one of the toughest jobs on earth: the Finance Minister responsible for the reconstruction of Afghanistan. This experience grounds the analysis of failed states in a rare sense of realism. Here, he and Clare Lockhart cover the full array of problems that beset failed states, which range far beyond the conventional remit of development agencies."--Paul Collier, author of <em>The Bottom Billion</em><p></p><br>"The authors...offer a persuasive critique of the ill-conceived, incoherent 'aid complex' run by the U.N. and other agencies, which, they argue, undermines and supersedes weak states instead of stabilizing them."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Foundations of Mathematics</h2><p>"There are many textbooks available for a so-called transition course from calculus to abstract mathematics. I have taught this course several times and always find it problematic. <em>The Foundations of Mathematics</em> (Stewart and Tall) is a horse of a different color. The writing is excellent and there is actually some useful mathematics. I definitely like this book."--<em>The Bulletin of Mathematics Books</em></p><p>Ian Stewart is Professor of Mathematics at Warwick University, and Director of the Mathematics Awareness Centre at Warwick. An active research mathematician, he is also a well-known popularizer of mathematics and related areas of science.<br>"In their writing of <em>Foundations of Mathematics</em>, the authors motivate, encourage and teach their readers. If I were to offer a future course in foundations, I would certainly use this book and highly recommend it to others, both as a reference and as a text." --<em>Frank Swetz, MAA Reviews</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Louisa Matthiasdottir: Small Paintings</h2><p>The artist&#39;s dazzling landscapes, still lifes, and self-portraits are a defining achievement of postwar American art, uniting bold colour, spare geometric composition, and naturalistic observation. Matthiasdottir returned regularly to her native Iceland, the subject of much of her work.</p><p>JED PERL is art critic of the New Republic and lives in New York, as does MARTICA SAWIN, who is an art teacher and art historian.In the first part of this wide-ranging survey, a noted British musicologist traces the metamorphosis of popular female singing from the blues of Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith to the club and cabaret work of Billie Holiday, Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Betty Carter, and the soul singing of Nina Simone and Aretha Franklin. Then he covers the jazz exploits of such white women as Mildred Bailey and Peggy Lee, the "rural" folksong revivals of Joan Baez and Judy Collins, the country songs of Dolly Parton and Linda Ronstadt. The longest sectiondescribing "the New Eve's search for social and creative identity in her New Ethnic Garden"ranges from Joni Mitchell and Carly Simon to Janis Joplin, Laura Nyro, Rickie Lee Jones and Laurie Anderson. Oddly, Mellers has included, in addition to a discography, a glossary defining classical music terms that are hardly mentioned, if at all, in the text.

What they do best is to provide caregivers and teachers ideas to be used in exploring the concept, using actual items rather than the books themselves. Each page is a vibrant, full-color photograph with a short caption or simple text, illustrating an example of the topic. Of the three books, Length is the most useful, comparing shoelaces and various other objects of different sizes. But other comparisons are appropriate only for use at the top of the age level, requiring children to visualize the length of a swimming pool or the distance of a running race. Comparison of different sized paces or handspans are presented to demonstrate why standard measurements are necessary, a good way to introduce the idea if actually carried out. The concepts in Capacity are too advanced for average preschoolers even using tangible objects, but to present a picture of a variety of containers and expect an accurate response to the question of which holds more is simply inviting frustration for all involved. Patterns suffers from a similar problem; children are introduced to the concept using a simple checkerboard layout, but then are expected to see pattern in an aerial view of irregular rooftops, the border of a carpet, plaid, a wallpaper repeat, and the petals of a flower (which is more an example of symmetry than pattern). In all, it's a lovely package of questionable content; better to use the money on rulers, measuring cups, and colored blocks. --Denise L.

For that purpose, it uses authentic readings especially compiled for the purpose drawn largely from Theravada canonical works, both prose and poetry. The reading are in Roman script, and carefully graded for difficulty, but they have also been selected so that each of them is a meaningful and complete reading in itself, so as to introduce some basic concepts and ways of thought of Theravada Buddhism. This book thus offers and opportunity to become acquainted with the ways in which the teachings of the Buddha are embodied in the language, a sense that it impossible to determine from English translations. The book contains 12 lessons. Each of them has three parts: (1) a set of basic readings and an accompanying glossary, (2) grammatical notes on the forms in the less, and (3) a set of further readings with its own glossary. The further readings introduce no new grammatical points, but reinforce ones already presented and give further practice in them. The work concludes, fittingly, with the Buddha s first sermon, The Dhammacakkapavattana Sutta. A cumulative glossary and index to the grammar is also provided. <br><br> The text has been used successfully in its preliminary form at several universities, but it may also be used for self-study.</p><p>Text: English</p><h2>Ezra-Nehemiah (Anchor Bible Series, Vol. 14)</h2><p><i>Ezra and Nememiah</i> (Volume 14 in the acclaimed Anchor Bible series) continue the spiritual history of Jerusalem begun in <i>II Chronicles</i> ; they relate the retum of the Jewish people to their home from exile in Babylonia and the revitalization of the Jewish religion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Two remarkable personalities--with strikingly different approaches to the same objective--played dominant roles in this rebuilding of a nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ezra, the learned, pious, scribal priest, known among his contemporaries as "the second Moses," was the architect of spiritual reform.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nehemiah, the forceful, shrewd, resourceful administrator, was the master international politician.<br><br>The importance of Ezra and Nememiah is, however, not only historical.&nbsp;&nbsp;With I and II Chronicles, believed to be written by the same author, Ezra and Nememiah comprise of an exceedingly complex jigsaw puzzle of parallels, direct quotes, and retellings, in some cases, of the same stories--all of which is, perhaps, more absorbing for the scholar than for the layman.&nbsp;&nbsp;But a study of Ezra and Nememiah--and the conclusions to which it leads--is crucial to an understanding of who wrote which portions of the Bible, how and when they came to be written, and what that understanding tells us ultimately about how the Bible, bit by bit over a period of almost a thousand years, came into being.</p><p><p>Jacob M.

This biography, the first in English in nearly two decades, undertakes to answer central questions about Jabotinsky as a writer, a political thinker, and a leader. Hillel Halkin sets aside the stereotypes to which Jabotinsky has been reduced by his would-be followers and detractors alike.<br> &nbsp;<br> Halkin explains the importance of Odessa, Jabotinsky&#x2019;s native city, in molding his character and outlook; discusses his novels and short stories, showing the sometimes hidden connections between them and Jabotinsky&#x2019;s political thought, and studies a political career that ended in tragic failure. Halkin also addresses Jabotinsky&#x2019;s position, unique among the great figures of Zionist history, as both a territorial maximalist and a principled believer in democracy. The author inquires why Jabotinsky was often accused of fascist tendencies though he abhorred authoritarian and totalitarian politics, and investigates the many opposed aspects of his personality and conduct while asking whether or not they had an ultimate coherence. Few figures in twentieth-century Jewish life were quite so admired and loathed, and Halkin&#x2019;s splendid, subtle book explores him with empathy and lucidity.<br> &nbsp;<b>About Jewish Lives</b>:&nbsp;<br><br> Jewish Lives is a prizewinning series of interpretative biography designed to explore the many facets of Jewish identity. Individual volumes illuminate the imprint of Jewish figures upon literature, religion, philosophy, politics, cultural and economic life, and the arts and sciences. Subjects are paired with authors to elicit lively, deeply informed books that explore the range and depth of the Jewish experience from antiquity to the present.<br><br> In 2014, the Jewish Book Council named Jewish Lives the winner of its Jewish Book of the Year Award, the first series ever to receive this award.<br><br><b>More praise for Jewish Lives:</b><br><br> "Excellent"&nbsp;&#x2013;New York Times<br><br> "Exemplary"&nbsp;&#x2013;Wall Street Journal<br><br> "Distinguished"&nbsp;&#x2013;New Yorker<br><br> "Superb"&nbsp;&#x2013;The Guardian</p><p><b>Hillel Halkin</b> is a writer, critic, and translator.

Henderson, one of the first generation of Jungian analysts, and Dyane N. Sherwood, a practising analyst, this book is a striking and unique contribution to the resurgence of interest in alchemy for its way of representing the phenomenology of creative experience. <br><br><em>Transformation of the Psyche</em> is organized around 22 illuminated paintings from the early Renaissance alchemical manuscript the <em>Splendor Solis</em>, and is further illustrated by over 50 colour figures. The images of the <em>Splendor Solis</em> are possibly the most beautiful and evocative alchemical paintings to be found anywhere, and they are widely known to students of alchemy. Jung reproduced several <em>Splendor Solis</em> images in his works, yet prior to this book no one has explored the symbolism of the paintings as a series in relation to the process of depth psychological transformation. This book is the first scholarly study of the paintings in their entirety, and of the mythological and historical allusions contained within the images. <em>Transformation of the Psyche</em> does not simply explain or analyze the pictures, but invites the reader to participate in the creative and transforming process evoked by these images.<br><br><em>Transformation of the Psyche</em> is a truly unique book that will be of immense value and interest to analysts and psychotherapists, as well as scholars of mediaeval and renaissance intellectual history and students of spiritual disciplines.</p><p><strong>Joseph L.

Barbara Tuchman reveals both the great rhythms of history and the grain and texture of domestic life as it was lived. Here are the guilty passions, loyalties and treacheries, political assassinations, sea battles and sieges, corruption in high places and a yearning for reform, satire and humor, sorcery and demonology, and lust and sadism on the stage. Here are proud cardinals, beggars, feminists, university scholars, grocers, bankers, mercenaries, mystics, lawyers and tax collectors, and, dominating all, the knight in his valor and &#34;furious follies,&#34; a &#34;terrible worm in an iron cocoon.&#34;</p><p>In this sweeping historical narrative, Barbara Tuchman writes of the cataclysmic 14th century, when the energies of medieval Europe were devoted to fighting internecine wars and warding off the plague. Some medieval thinkers viewed these disasters as divine punishment for mortal wrongs; others, more practically, viewed them as opportunities to accumulate wealth and power. One of the latter, whose life informs much of Tuchman&#39;s book, was the French nobleman Enguerrand de Coucy, who enjoyed the opulence and elegance of the courtly tradition while ruthlessly exploiting the peasants under his thrall. Tuchman looks into such events as the Hundred Years War, the collapse of the medieval church, and the rise of various heresies, pogroms, and other events that caused medieval Europeans to wonder what they had done to deserve such horrors.Anyone who has read THE GUNS OF AUGUST or STILWELL AND THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE IN CHINA, knows that Barbara Tuchman was one of the most gifted American writers of this century. Her subject was history, but her profiles of great men and great events are drawn with such power that reading Tuchman becomes a riveting experience<br><br>In A DISTANT MIRROR, Barbara Tuchman illuminates the Dark Ages. Her description of medieval daily life, the role of the church, the influence of the Great Plagues, and the social and political conventions that make this period of history so engrossing, are carefully woven into an integrated narrative that sweeps the reader along.<br><br> I am a particular devotee of medieval and pre Renaissance music, so Barbara Tuchman's brilliant analysis of this period has special meaning for me - and I hope for many others.<br><br>George Davidson, Director of Production, The Ballantine Publishing Group</p><h2>The Custom of the Sea</h2><p>"The nightmarish events of the shipwreck are reported with real power."-New York Times Book Review<br> <br> Adrift at sea, your food and water gone, you are slowly starving to death: what would you do to survive?<br> <br> On May 19, 1884, the yacht Mignonette set sail from Southampton, England, bound for Australia. Halfway through the voyage, the crew were beset by a monstrous storm off the coast of West Africa, and the Mignonette was sunk by a massive forty-foot wave. Cast adrift a thousand miles from landfall with no food or water and faced with almost certain death, the captain resorted to a grisly practice common among seamen of the time: the "custom of the sea." While the others watched, the captain killed the weakest of them, the cabin boy, and his body was eaten. In this riveting account of the ordeal of the crew and the sensational trial that followed, Hanson recreates the shocking events that held a nation spellbound. Drawing from newspaper accounts, personal letters, court proceedings, and first-person accounts, he has brilliantly told a tale rife with moral dilemmas.</p><p>What would you do to survive if you were adrift at sea, without food or water, and slowly starving to death? <p> In 1884, Captain Tom Dudley and his three-man crew were faced with just such a predicament. Dudley and his men were aboard the <i>Mignonette</i>, a small yacht they were delivering from England to Australia. Hit by a rogue wave in a storm, the <i>Mignonette</i> sank, leaving the four men in a 13-foot dinghy with two pounds of turnips and little else--no other food and no water--in the middle of the Atlantic. After nearly two weeks, Dudley announced they would have to resort to "the custom of the sea": drawing lots to decide who would be sacrificed and eaten to save the others. Two crewmen argued against lots, pointing out that the young cabin boy, Richard Parker, was delirious and on the verge of death. Dudley refused to kill the boy, and a few more days passed. Finally, on the 19th day adrift, Dudley killed young Parker while his crew watched. Three days later, the three survivors were rescued. Upon their return to England the three men were arrested and charged with murder.</p><p> Neil Hanson tells the story of the <i>Mignonette</i> and its crew in <i>Custom of the Sea</i>. At its best, the book reads like an adventure story along the lines of <i>The Perfect Storm</i> or <i>Endurance</i>. The story lags a bit when the survivors get entangled in the Victorian court and penal system--which is understandably a bit less gripping than the shipwreck and its ensuing survival cannibalism. It does, however, provide a fascinating window into the legal system and the power of the press in influencing public opinion.</p><p> Captain Simonsen of the <i>Moctezuma</i>, having rescued the <i>Mignonette</i> survivors, realized what they had done and tried to comfort Dudley by saying, "Desperate straits require desperate measures." <i>Custom of the Sea</i> does an excellent job of putting readers in a position to wonder if they too would take such desperate measures. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>Cast adrift in a tiny boat on a vast and desolate ocean, faced with almost certain death, what would you do to survive? This is the agonizing question that lies at the heart of the gripping true drama of The Custom of the Sea. <p>On May 19, 1884, the yacht Mignonette set sail from Southampton, England, bound for Sydney, Australia. Halfway through the 12,000-mile voyage, Captain Tom Dudley and his three- member crew were beset by a monstrous storm off the coast of West Africa. After four terrifying days battling towering waves and hurricane-force gales, the Mignonette was sunk by a massive forty-foot "freak" wave.</p> <p>Captain Dudley and his crew were cast adrift a thousand miles from the nearest land in a leaky thirteen-foot dinghy with only two small tins of turnips for food, no water, and no shelter from the scorching sun. After nineteen days, they were all near death, and Dudley determined that they must resort to the horrifying practice well known among seamen of the time called "the custom of the sea." While the others watched, the captain killed the weakest of them, the seventeen-year-old cabin boy, and his body was eaten. Five days later, the survivors were picked up by a passing ship, and although such cases of survival cannibalism were usually either hushed up or condoned as terrible but justified acts of desperation, in this case the men were arrested for murder. The sensational trial that followed kept a shocked public enthralled during the following winter, from the lowliest ship&#x2019;s deckhand to Queen Victoria herself. In this riveting account, Neil Hanson re-creates with vivid detail the harrowing ordeal of the Mignonette&#x2019;s crew. Drawing from newspaper accounts, personal letters and diaries, court proceedings, and first-person accounts of the principals, he has brilliantly pieced together their tragic story, a talerife with moral twists and turns that will draw you deeper and deeper into the drama of the men&#x2019;s fate.</p> <p>Four shipwrecked sailors...one must die so the others might live.<br> What should they do?<br> A terrifying true-to-life account of peril on the high seas&#x2014;and of the electrifying murder trial that shocked the world.</p> <p>Praise for THE CUSTOM OF THE SEA</p> <p>"Makes astonishing reading . . . extraordinary." &#x2014;Times Literary Supplement (London)<br> "An engrossing account."&#x2014;The Sunday Times (London)<br> "A terrific story. . . .

Reissue.</p><p>Humans created the sentient robot &#34;boppers,&#34; but now it&#39;s the boppers who have started creating humans. Clones and DNA-splicing have spawned the meatbop, a human body infused with the software (the mind and personality) of a bopper. The meatbops are interested in propagating down on Earth, but that might not be so good for humanity (the boppers have a nasty habit of enslaving humans, actually). When a couple of (reasonably) innocent humans get tangled up in the bopper&#39;s machinations on the moon, it&#39;s time to drag out the stored mind of bopper-creator Cobb Anderson and see if he can help.Rudy Rucker is a world-class mathematician and two-time winner of the Philip K.

The Marketing Game is applicable for all areas of Marketing and all levels because the game is not based on just one simulation. Rather it is based on several simulations with one integrated framework. The instructor can decide the level of complexity by selecting the number of decision areas a student is forced to consider, thus making the game equally applicable for a first year Principles student and a Graduate student. The instructor can also &#x201c;set up&#x201d; or adjust the marketing environments in the simulation to meet specific learning or teaching objections, and can decide if students will compete in groups against each other, or simply against themselves. The Marketing Game is based on realistic marketing and realistic marketing relationships, and allows for maximum flexibility.</p><p>Currently Kenan Professor at the University of North Carolina Kenan-Flagler Business School.</p><h2>The Book of Acts (The Smart Guide to the Bible Series)</h2><p><p><b><i>The</i> Book for Authentic Christian Living and Fellowship</b></p><p>The early church was filled with Christians who had seen Jesus, and who were committed to telling His story for the benefit of future generations of God's family. <i>The Smart Guide to the Bible: The Book of Acts</i> connects you to the people and events that shaped the church as we know it today.

It opens with a survey of the Ch&#39;ing empire in China and Inner Asia at its height, in about 1800. Contributors study the complex interplay of foreign invasion, domestic rebellion and Ch&#39;ing decline and restoration. Special reference is made to the Peking administration, the Canton trade and the early treaty system, the Taiping, Nien and other rebellions, and the dynasty&#39;s survival in uneasy cooperation with the British, Russian, French, American and other invaders. Each chapter is written by a specialist from the international community of sinological scholars. No knowledge of Chinese is necessary; for readers with Chinese, proper names and terms are identified with their characters in the glossary, and full references to Chinese, Japanese and other works are given in the bibliographies.

(What, after all, is your run-of-the-mill scribbler of stories if not an accomplished corruptor of conceptions?) The logic of the club is strict and uncompromising. Every Saturday, members meet in a firelit room filled with empty black bookshelves where they strive to top one another by developing ever unlikelier, ever more perfect conceptions: a rehearsal of Hamlet hijacked by an actor who vanishes with the role; the double life of a merry medieval cleric derailed by a costume change; a machine-run world that imprisons men&#x2019;s minds while conscripting their bodies; a dead Roman scribe stranded this side of the River Acheron. But in this book set in an ominous Soviet Moscow of the 1920s, the members of the club are strangely mistrustful of one another, while all are under the spell of its despotic President, and there is no telling, in the end, just how lethal the purely conceptual&#x2014;or, for that matter, letters&#x2014;may be.</p><p>Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky (1887&#x2013;1950), the Ukrainian-born son of Polish emigrants, studied law and classical philology at Kiev University. After graduation and two summers spent exploring Europe, he was obliged to clerk for an attorney. A sinecure, the job allowed him to devote most of his time to literature and his own writing. In 1920, he began lecturing in Kiev on theater and music. The lectures continued in Moscow, where he moved in 1922, by then well known in literary circles. Lodged in a cell-like room on the Arbat, Krzhizhanovsky wrote steadily for close to two decades. His philosophical and phantasmagorical fictions ignored injunctions to portray the Soviet state in a positive light. Three separate efforts to print collections were quashed by the censors, a fourth by World War II . Not until 1989 could his work begin to be published. Like Poe, Krzhizhanovsky takes us to the edge of the abyss and forces us to look into it. &#x201c;I am interested,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;not in the arithmetic, but in the algebra of life.&#x201d;<br><br>Joanne Turnbull&#x2019;s translations from Russian in collaboration with Nikolai Formozov include Sigizmund Krzhizhanovsky&#x2019;s <i>Memories of the Future </i>(NYRB Classics), short-listed for the Best Translated Book Award.<br><br>Caryl Emerson is the A.

This masterfully crafted book interweaves conversations between Campbell and some of the people he inspired, including poet Robert Bly, anthropologist Angeles Arrien, filmmaker David Kennard, Doors drummer John Densmore, psychiatric pioneer Stanislov Grof, Nobel laureate Roger Guillemen, and others. Campbell reflects on subjects ranging from the origins and functions of myth, the role of the artist, and the need for ritual to the ordeals of love and romance. With poetry and humor, Campbell recounts his own quest and conveys the excitement of his lifelong exploration of our mythic traditions, what he called the one great story of mankind.&#x201d;</p><p>The man behind the myth is lovingly revealed in this collection of interviews with the late Joseph Campbell. Using Campbell's format for the "hero's journey," editor Phil Cousineau organized these interviews so that they reflect Campbell's own chronological life quest. He begins with "The Call to Adventure," in which Campbell speaks to his fascination with Native American myth as a child, and moves through "The Road of Trials" (his years in college and as a young professor at Sarah Lawrence) and the "Meeting with the Goddess" (referring to meeting his wife of 50 years, the modern dancer Jean Erdman). Since most of the book is written in a question and answer format (with a few excerpts from lectures), much of the text is in Campbell's own words. It is a feast for any fan to hear Campbell speak so personally about his own life while also imparting his usual insight and wisdom on every topic he discusses.<p> A few morsels of this feast can be found in the following tidbits: for example, readers may be surprised to discover that Campbell considered his half-mile track races in college to be the "peak" experiences of his life. (Campbell was an esteemed track star at Columbia University in the mid-1920s.) Or that it was the famous Paris-dweller and bookseller Sylvia Beach who helped Campbell understand the meaning behind <i>Ulysses</i> in 1928 and was influential in steering Campbell into the realm of mythology and heroes. Or that Campbell believed that his uncanny ability to relate myths to contemporary life came from teaching female students at Sarah Lawrence. "They always wanted the material to relate to themselves, to life," he explained to interviewer Stuart Brown. "I attribute the popular aspects of my writing to the training I got from these students." Or that <i>The Hero with a Thousand Faces</i> inspired numerous artists, including George Lucas of <i>Star Wars</i> fame and Richard Adams, author of <i>Watership Down</i>.</p><p> This is also a generously illustrated book, with numerous photos of Campbell, many of which are shown in their authentic sepia tones. Numerous full-color images of famous artwork and images speak to each mythological theme in the book, such as the "Death of Socrates" (Jacques Louis David, 1787) and the painting of "Sacred and Profane" (Titan, circa 1514). <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><b>Joseph Campbell</b> (1904&#x2013;1987) is widely credited with bringing mythology to a mass audience.

It is the story of successive generations of Jack Russell terriers, their animal friends, and their human companions. Alston Chase searches for the immortality of dogs, what makes them unique companions, and why we humans willingly give them our hearts knowing that someday they will be broken. This book will resonate with anyone who has ever loved a dog.</p><p>Chase muses that dogs are the embodiment of spirit over mortality and through the window of their brief lives we glimpse eternity. This eternal includes the Earth, the land, and the bonds forged between people and dogs over thousands of years. Chase sees threats in the decline of rural life, unbridled urbanization, and in dog breeders who judge by conformation to breed standards and fashion rather than ability and health.</p><p>An uplifting tribute to the dogs we love, and a reflection on the limitations of life, this book shows a triumph of the spirit. Rich in poetic citations, it is an environmental cry for help, a naturalistic appreciation of a dissolving world, and a deeply spiritual reminder that nothing loved is ever lost.</p></p><p><p><em>Alston Chase</em> has written widely on natural history, the environment, and animal welfare.

Mathematician, philosopher, outdoorsman, and amateur economist, Chase addresses many difficult subjects here, in a direct, yes, Thoreauvian prose style.

Stop your daydreaming or you&#x2019;ll think Zeus&#x2019;s thunderbolts are landing on your shoulders!&#x201d;I was sitting on a rough wooden bench along the gunwale of a long, wallowing boat, a heavy oar in my hands. No, not an oar. A paddle. We were rowing hard, under a hot high sun. I could see the sweat streaming down the emaciated ribs and spine of the man in front of me. There were welts across his nut-brown skin.&#x201c;Pull!&#x201d; the man with the whip roared. &#x201c;Stay with the beat.&#x201d;I wore nothing but a stained leather loincloth. Sweat stung my eyes. My back and arms ached. My hands were callused and dirty.The boat was like a Hawaiian war canoe. The prow rose high into a grotesquely carved figurehead; some fierce demonic spirit, I guessed, to protect the boat and its crew. I glanced swiftly around as I dug my paddle into the heaving dark sea and counted forty rowers. Amidships there were bales of goods, tethered sheep and pigs that squealed with every roll of the deck.The sun blazed overhead. The wind was fitful and light. The boat&#x2019;s only sail was furled against its mast. I could smell the stench of the animals&#x2019; droppings. Toward the stern a brawny bald man was beating a single large mallet on a well-worn drum, as steady as a metronome. We drove our paddles into the water in time with his beat&#x2014;or took a sting from the rowing master&#x2019;s whip.Other men were gathered down by the stern, standing, shading their eyes with one hand and pointing with the other as they spoke with one another. They wore clean knee-length linen tunics and cloaks of red or blue that went down to midcalf. Small daggers at their belts, more for ornamentation than combat, I judged. Silver inlaid hilts. Gold clasps on their cloaks. They were young men, lean, their beards light. But their faces were grave, not jaunty. They were looking toward something that sobered their youthful spirits. I followed their gaze and saw a headland not far off, a low treeless rocky rise at the end of a sandy stretch of beach. Obviously our destination was beyond that promontory.Where was I? How did I get here? Frantically I ransacked my mind. The last firm memory I could find was of a beautiful, tall, gray-eyed woman who loved me and whom I loved. We were ... a shudder of blackest grief surged through me. She was dead.My mind went spinning, as if a whirlpool had opened in the dark sea and dragged me down into it. Dead. Yes. There was a ship, a very different ship. One that traveled not through the water but through the vast emptiness between stars. I had been on that ship with her. And it exploded. She died. She was killed. We were both killed.Yet I lived, sweaty, dirty, my back stinging with welts, on this strangely primitive oversized canoe heading for an unknown land under a brazen cloudless sky.Who am I? With a sudden shock of fright I realized that I could remember nothing about myself except my name. I am Orion, I told myself. But more than that I could not recall. My memory was a blank, as if it had been wiped clean, like a classroom chalkboard being prepared for a new lesson.I squeezed my eyes shut and forced myself to think about that woman I had loved and that fantastic star-leaping ship. I could not even remember her name. I saw flames, heard screams. I held her in my arms as the heat blistered our skins and made the metal walls around us glow hell-red.&#x201c;He&#x2019;s beaten us, Orion,&#x201d; she said to me. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll die together. That&#x2019;s the only consolation we will have, my love.&#x201d;I remembered pain. Not merely the agony of flesh searing and splitting open, steaming and cooking even as our eyes were burned away, but the torture of being torn apart forever from the one woman in all the universes whom I loved.The whip cracked against my bare back again.&#x201c;Harder! Pull harder, you whoreson, or by the gods I&#x2019;ll sacrifice <i>you</i> instead of a bullock once we make landfall!&#x201d;He leaned over me, his scarred face red with anger, and slashed at me again with the whip. The pain of the lash was nothing. I closed it off without another thought. I always could control my body completely. Had I wanted to, I could have snapped this hefty paddle in two and driven the ragged end of it through the whipmaster&#x2019;s thick skull. But what was the sting of his whip compared to the agony of death, the hopelessness of loss?We rowed around the rocky headland and saw a calm sheltered inlet. Spread along the curving beach were dozens of ships like our own, pulled far up on the sand. Huts and tents huddled among their black hulls like shreds of paper littering a city street after a parade. Thin gray smoke issued from cook fires here and there. A pall of thicker, blacker smoke billowed off in the distance.A mile or so inland, up on a bluff that commanded the beach, stood a city or citadel of some sort. High stone walls with square towers rising above the battlements. Far in the distance, dark wooded hills rose and gradually gave way to mountains that floated shimmering in the blue heat haze.The young men at the stern seemed to get tenser at the sight of the walled city. Their voices were low, but I heard them easily enough.&#x201c;There is it,&#x201d; one of them said to his companions. His voice was grim.The youth next to him nodded and spoke a single word.&#x201c;Troy.&#x201d;Copyright � 1988 by Ben Bova</p><h2>Constantin Brancusi</h2><p>In twentieth-century sculpture, one name towers above all others: Romanian-born Constantin Brancusi (1876-1957).

Plath trained as a studio artist before her sophomore year at Smith and her work in tempera and watercolor paintings, pastels, ink, crayon and pencil drawings, and other media reveals a talent that both complements and illuminates her genius as a writer.<br> <em>Eye Rhymes</em> brings together essays by six Plath scholars-including renowned authors Diane Middlebrook, Landgon Hammer and Christiana Britzolakis, book editors Kathleen Connors and Sally Bayley, and Fan Jinghua-and contextualizes approximately sixty of Plath's visual works within her writing oeuvre, starting with juvenilia that reveal the extensive play between her two disciplines. Special attention is given to Plath's unpublished teen diaries and book reports containing drawings and early textual experiments, created years before her famous "I am I" diary notes of age seventeen, when critical examination of her writing usually begins. The book offers new critical approaches to the artist's multidimensional output, including writing that appropriates sophisticated visual and color effects years after painting and drawing became her hobby and writing her chosen profession. The essays gathered here also relate Plath's visual art interests to her early identity as a writer in Cambridge, her teen artwork and writing on war, mid-career "art poems" on the works of de Chirico, her representations of womanhood within mid-century commercial culture, and her visual aesthetics in poetry.<br> Filled with stunning reproductions of her art and fresh readings of many of her most important poems, <em>Eye Rhymes</em> offers readers a new way of understanding the full range of Plath's creative expression.</p><p><br><strong>Kathleen Connors</strong> served as director and curator for "The Arts of Sylvia Plath" project at Indiana University in 2002, featuring a literary symposium, an exhibition of Plath's art and manuscripts and a 70th year birthday commemoration.

Porter of the Harvard Business School established himself as the world's leading authority on competitive advantage. Now, at a time when economic performance rather than military might will be the index of national strength, Porter builds on the seminal ideas of his earlier works to explore what makes a nation's firms and industries competitive in global markets and propels a whole nation's economy. In so doing, he presents a brilliant new paradigm which, in addition to its practical applications, may well supplant the 200-year-old concept of "comparative advantage" in economic analysis of international competitiveness. </p><p> To write this important new work, Porter and his associates conducted in-country research in ten leading nations, closely studying the patterns of industry success as well as the company strategies and national policies that achieved it. The nations are Britain, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States. The three leading industrial powers are included, as well as other nations intentionally varied in size, government policy toward industry, social philosophy, and geography. </p><p> Porter's research identifies the fundamental determinants of national competitive advantage in an industry, and how they work together as a system. He explains the important phenomenon of "clustering," in which related groups of successful firms and industries emerge in one nation to gain leading positions in the world market. Among the over 100 industries examined are the German chemical and printing industries, Swiss textile equipment and pharmaceuticals, Swedish mining equipment and truck manufacturing, Italian fabric and home appliances, and American computer software and movies. Building on his theory of national advantage in industries and clusters, Porter identifies the stages of competitive development through which entire national economies advance and decline. </p><p> Porter's finding are rich in implications for both firms and governments. He describes how a company can tap and extend its nation's advantages in international competition. He provides a blueprint for government policy to enhance national competitive advantage and also outlines the agendas in the years ahead for the nations studied. This is a work which will become the standard for all further discussions of global competition and the sources of the new wealth of nations.</p></p><p>MICHAEL E. PORTER teaches at the Harvard Business School, is an advisor to leading companies all over the world, and served on the US President's Commission on Industrial Competitiveness. He is the author of <em>Competitive Strategy</em> (1980) and <em>Competitive Advantage</em> (1985).<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>The Need for a New Paradigm</b><br><br>Why do some nations succeed and others fail in international competition? This question is perhaps the most frequently asked economic question of our times. Competitiveness has become one of the central preoccupations of government and industry in every nation. The United States is an obvious example, with its growing public debate about the apparently greater economic success of other trading nations. But intense debate about competitiveness is also taking place today in such "success story" nations as Japan and Korea. Socialist countries such as the Soviet Union and others in Eastern Europe and Asia are also asking this question as they fundamentally reappraise their economic systems.<br><br>Yet although the question is frequently asked, it is the wrong question if the aim is to best expose the underpinnings of economic prosperity for either firms or nations. We must focus instead on another, much narrower one. This is: why does a nation become the home base for successful international competitors in an industry? Or, to put it somewhat differently, why are firms based in a particular nation able to create and sustain competitive advantage against the world's best competitors in a particular field? And why is one nation often the home for so many of an industry's world leaders?<br><br>How can we explain why Germany is the home base for so many of the world's leading makers of printing presses, luxury cars, and chemicals? Why is tiny Switzerland the home base for international leaders in pharmaceuticals, chocolate, and trading? Why are leaders in heavy trucks and mining equipment based in Sweden? Why has America produced the preeminent international competitors in personal computers, software, credit cards, and movies? Why are Italian firms so strong in ceramic tiles, ski boots, packaging machinery, and factory automation equipment? What makes Japanese firms so dominant in consumer electronics, cameras, robotics, and facsimile machines?<br><br>The answers are obviously of central concern to firms that must compete in increasingly international markets. A firm must understand what it is about its home nation that is most crucial in determining its ability, or inability, to create and sustain competitive advantage in international terms. But the same question will prove to be a decisive one for national economic prosperity as well. As we will see, a nation's standard of living in the long term depends on its ability to attain a high and rising level of productivity in the industries in which its firms compete. This rests on the capacity of its firms to achieve improving quality or greater efficiency. The influence of the home nation on the pursuit of competitive advantage in particular fields is of central importance to the level and rate of productivity growth achievable.<br><br>But we lack a convincing explanation of the influence of the nation. The long-dominant paradigm for why nations succeed internationally in particular industries is showing signs of strain. There is an extensive history of theories to explain the patterns of nations' exports and imports, dating back to the work of Adam Smith and David Ricardo in the eighteenth century. It has become generally recognized, however, that these theories have grown inadequate to the task. Changes in the nature of international competition, among them the rise of the multinational corporation that not only exports but competes abroad via foreign subsidiaries, have weakened the traditional explanations for why and where a nation exports. While new rationales have been proposed, none is sufficient to explain why firms based in particular nations are able to compete successfully, through both exporting <i>and</i> foreign investment, in particular industries. Nor can they explain why a nation's firms are able to sustain their competitive positions over considerable periods of time.<br><br>Explaining the role played by a nation's economic environment, institutions, and policies in the competitive success of its finns in particular industries is the subject of this book. It seeks to isolate the competitive advantage of a nation, that is, the national attributes that foster competitive advantage in an industry. Drawing on my study of ten nations and the detailed histories of over one hundred industries, I will present in Part I a theory of the competitive advantage of nations in particular fields. In Part II, I will illustrate how the theory can be employed to explain the competitive success of particular nations in a number of individual industries. In Part III, I will use the theory to shed light on the overall patterns of industry success and failure in the economies of the nations we studied and how the patterns have been changing. This will serve as the basis for presenting a framework to explain how entire national economies advance in competitive terms. Finally, in Part IV, I will develop the implications of my theory for both company strategy and government policy, The book concludes with a chapter entitled "National Agendas," which illustrates how the theory can be used to identify some of the most important issues that will shape future economic progress in each of the nations I studied.<br><br>Before presenting my theory, however, I must explain why efforts to explain the competitiveness of <i>an entire nation</i> have been unconvincing, and why attempting to do so is tackling the wrong question. I must demonstrate that understanding the reasons for the ability of the nation's firms to create and sustain competitive advantage in particular industries is addressing the right question, not only for informing company strategy but also for achieving national economic goals. I must also describe why there is a growing consensus that the dominant paradigm used to date to explain international success in particular industries is inadequate, and why even recent efforts to modify it still do not address some of the most central questions. Finally, I will describe the study that was conducted so, that the reader will understand the factual foundations of what follows.<br><br>CONFLICTING EXPLANATIONS<br><br>There has been no shortage of explanations for why some nations are competitive and others are not. Yet these explanations are often conflicting, and there is no generally accepted theory. It is far from clear what the term "competitive" means when referring to a nation. This is a major part of the difficulty, as we will see. That there has been intense debate in many nations about whether they have a competitiveness problem in the first place is a sure sign that the subject is not completely understood.<br><br>Some see national competitiveness as a macroeconomic phenomenon, driven by such variables as exchange rates, interest rates, and government deficits. But nations have enjoyed rapidly rising living standards despite budget deficits (Japan, Italy, and Korea), appreciating currencies (Germany and Switzerland), and high interest rates (Italy and Korea).<br><br>Others argue that competitiveness is a function of cheap and abundant labor. Yet nations such as Germany, Switzerland, and Sweden have prospered despite high wages and long periods of labor shortage. Japan, with an economy supposedly built on cheap, abundant labor, has also experienced pressing labor shortages. Its firms have succeeded internationally in many industries only after automating away much of the labor content. The ability to compete <i>despite</i> paying high wages would seem to represent a far more desirable national target.<br><br>Another view is that competitiveness depends on possessing bountiful natural resources. Recently, however, the most successful trading nations, among them Germany, Japan, Switzerland, Italy, and Korea, have been countries with limited natural resources that must import most raw materials. It is also interesting to note that within nations such as Korea, the United Kingdom, and Germany, it is the resource-poor regions that are prospering relative to the resource-rich ones.<br><br>More recently, many have argued that competitiveness is most strongly influenced by government policy. This view identifies targeting, protection, export promotion, and subsidies as the keys to international success. Evidence is drawn from the study of a few nations (notably Japan and Korea) and a few large, highly visible industries such as automobiles, steel, shipbuilding, and semiconductors. Yet such a decisive role for government policy in competitiveness is not confirmed by a broader survey of experience. Many observers would consider government policy toward industry in Italy, for example, to have been largely ineffectual in much of the postwar period, but Italy has seen a rise in world export share second only to Japan along with a rapidly rising standard of living.<br><br>Significant government policy intervention has occurred in only a subset of industries, and it is far from universally successful even in Japan and Korea. In Japan, for example, government's role in such important industries as facsimile, copiers, robotics, and advanced materials has been modest, and such frequently cited examples of successful Japanese policy as sewing machines, steel, and shipbuilding are now dated. Conversely, sustained targeting by Japan of industries such as aircraft (first targeted in 1971) and software (1978) has failed to yield meaningful international positions. Aggressive Korean targeting in large, important sectors such as chemicals and machinery has also failed to lead to significant market positions. Looking across nations, the industries in which government has been most heavily involved have, for the most part, been unsuccessful in international terms. Government is indeed an actor in international competition, but rarely does it have the starting role.<br><br>A final popular explanation for national competitiveness is differences in management practices, including labor-management relations. Japanese management has been particularly celebrated in the 1980s, just as American management was in the 1950s and 1960s. The problem with this explanation, however, is that different industries require different approaches to management. What is celebrated as good management practice in one industry would be disastrous in another. The small, private, and loosely organized family firms that populate the Italian footwear, textile, and jewelry industries, for example, are hotbeds of innovation and dynamism. Each industry has produced a positive trade balance for Italy in excess of $1 billion annually. However, these same structures and practices would be a disaster in a German chemical or automobile company, a Swiss pharmaceutical producer, or an American commercial aircraft manufacturer. American-style management, with all the flaws now attributed to it, produces highly competitive firms in such industries as software, medical equipment, consumer packaged goods, and business services. Japanese-style management, for all its strengths, has produced little international success in large portions of the economy such as chemicals, consumer packaged goods, or services.<br><br>Nor is it possible to generalize about labor-management relations. Unions are very powerful in Germany and Sweden, with representation by law in management (Germany) and on boards of directors (Sweden). Despite the view by some that powerful unions undermine competitive advantage, however, both nations have prospered and contain some of the most internationally preeminent firms and industries of any country.<br><br>Clearly, none of these explanations for national competitiveness, any more than a variety of others that have been put forward, is fully satisfactory. None is sufficient by itself in rationalizing the competitive position of a nation's industries. Each contains some truth but will not stand up to close scrutiny. A broader and more complex set of forces seems to be at work.<br><br>The numerous and conflicting explanations for competitiveness highlight an even more fundamental problem. That is, just what is a "competitive" nation in the first place? While the term is frequently used, it is unusually ill defined. Is a "competitive" nation one in which every firm or industry is competitive? If so, no nation comes close to qualifying. Even Japan, as we will see, has large sectors of its economy that fall far behind the world's best competititors. Is a "competitive" nation one whose exchange rate makes its goods price competitive in international markets? But surely most would agree that nations such as Germany and Japan, that have experienced sustained periods of a strong currency and upward pressure on foreign prices, have enjoyed remarkable gains in standard of living in the postwar period. The ability of a nation's industry to command <i>high</i> prices in foreign markets would seem to be a more desirable national target.<br><br>Is a "competitive" nation one with a large positive balance of trade? Switzerland has roughly balanced trade and Italy has had a chronic trade deficit, but both nations have enjoyed strongly rising national income. Conversely, many poor nations have balanced trade but scarcely represent the sorts of economies most nations aspire to Is a "competitive" nation one with a rising share of world exports? A rising share is often associated with growing prosperity, but nations with stable or slowly falling world export shares have experienced strong per capita income growth so that world export share clearly does not tell the whole story. Is a "competitive" nation one that can create jobs? Clearly, the ability to do so is important, but the <i>type</i> of jobs, not merely the employment of citizens at low wages, seems more significant for national income. Finally, is a "competitive" nation one whose unit labor costs are low? Low unit labor costs can be achieved through low wages such as those in India or Mexico, but this hardly seems an attractive industrial model. Each of these measures says something about a nation's industry, but none relates clearly to national economic prosperity.<br><br>ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTION<br><br>The search for a convincing explanation of both national and firm prosperity must begin by asking the right question. We must abandon the whole notion of a "competitive nation" as a term having much meaning for economic prosperity. The principal economic goal of a nation is to produce a high and rising standard of living for its citizens. The ability to do so depends not on the amorphous notion of "competitiveness" but on the productivity with which a nation's resources (labor and capital) are employed. Productivity is the value of the output produced by a unit of labor or capital. It depends on both the quality and features of products (which determine the prices they can command) and the efficiency with which they are produced.<br><br>Productivity is the prime determinant in the long run of a nation's standard of living, for it is the root cause of national per capita income. The productivity of human resources determines their wages, while the productivity with which capital is employed determines the return it earns for its holders. High productivity not only supports high levels of income but allows citizens the option of choosing more leisure instead of long working hours. It also creates the national income that is taxed to pay for public services which again boosts the standard of living The capacity to be highly productive also allows a nation's firms to meet stringent social standards which improve the standard of living, such as in health and safety, equal opportunity, and environmental impact.<br><br>The only meaningful concept of competitiveness at the national level is national productivity. A rising standard of living depends on the capacity of a nation's firms to achieve high lev...</p><h2>Essential Forensic Biology</h2><p><p>This book is an introduction to the application of biology in legal investigations.

Now Dr. Shengold offers his latest reflections on the circumstances in which the willful abuse and neglect of children arises and on the consequences of this abuse, providing compelling examples from literature and from clinical material.<br><br>Dr. Shengold describes various types of child abuse as well as techniques of adaptation and denial by soul murder victims. He explores the psychopathology of soul murder, addressing such issues as instinctual drives, aggression and sexuality, love, and narcissism. In a chapter on sadomasochism, he relates the story of Algernon Swinburne&#x2015;who may have been a victim of soul murder&#x2015;and he tells about Elizabeth Bishop, who, like Swinburne, has been able to use artistic creativity to transcend the damage sustained by early childhood trauma. Finally he offers suggestions about therapy for the abused and neglected, emphasizing the need to restore the power to care about and love others in order to ameliorate soul murder&#x2019;s narcissistically regressive effects. <br></p><p>Leonard Shengold is a training analyst and former Director of the Institute for Psychoanalytic Education (affiliated with NYU School of Medicine, where he is Clinical Professor of Psychiatry). He has published eight books including &#34;Soul Murder&#34; (1989), &#34;Haunted by Parents&#34; (2006), and over seventy-five papers on clinical, theoretical and applied psychoanalytic topics. He graduated from Columbia College and Downstate New York Medical School, was an officer in both the American and the International Psychoanalytic Associations, and is currently in private practice as a psychiatrist in New York City.In this mixture of clinical and literary studies, psychoanalyst Shengold (Soul Murder, Fawcett, 1991) returns to the subject of destructive parenting. He is less concerned with whether abuse actually happens than with its impact when it is only, or mainly, imagined and how to treat patients in either category. Chapters on Swinburne, Proust, and Elizabeth Bishop and discussion of Oedipus, Kipling, ring symbolism, and narcissism will interest readers who enjoy applications of psychoanalysis to literature. Clinicians will find useful ideas for victims of actual or virtual abuse. But Shengold will not win many converts to his pessimistic Freudian stance?he asserts the centrality of murder as a motivational force and speaks of "the inexorability of our own and our parents' burdens of evil." He alienates the unconverted further with the assertion that those who reject Freud are not strong enough to face the painful truth. Some good ideas mired in presumption posing as science, suitable for a sophisticated psychoanalytic audience.?E. James Lieberman, George Washington Univ.

What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>An Essay On French Verse: For Readers of English Poetry</h2><p>In <em>An Essay on French Verse&#x2013;For Readers of English Poetry</em>, Jacques Barzun addresses the baffling English prejudice against French poetry. Barzun&#x2019;s many-faceted and entertaining study muses on six hundred years of French verse, its rules and forms and how they evolved. It also has significant sections on the French language itself, its sounds and difficulties; on verse music in language generally; on the character and achievements of the greatest French poets; and finally, on the social and political conditions that encouraged successive innovations, including the prevailing wordwide practice of free verse. The <em>Essay</em>, moreover, draws not only on a lifetime&#x2019;s reading, but on personal reminiscences as well: of stuffy poetry lessons in the French lyc�e; of the poet Apollinaire expounding his views on language to amuse the child sitting on his knee; of the author&#x2019;s great-grandmother telling him about proper French pronunciation, as it was in her youth, eighty years earlier. In sum, Barzun&#x2019;s book goes a long way toward answering the question posed in 1917 by A. E. Housman to Andr� Gide: How is it that every nation has produced poetry except France?</p><p>Jacques Barzun (1907-2012) was a leading historian scholar on American culture. He was born in France.Barzun traces English speakers' prejudice toward French verse to a resistance to the French Neoclassicists writing between 1640 and 1830 and a misunderstanding of the French language. He illustrates the virtues of French poetry by showing how French, a vocalic, unstressed language, lends a great variety of rhythm to French verse, making it not at all monotonous. Early Romanticists, like Chenier, began to depict the abject poor, and Lamartine used lowly terms like "filthy clothes" and "naked swimmer" as early as 1821 in his Meditations Poetiques . Then Victor Hugo loosened the 12-syllable alexandrine, once straitjacketed by classists' rules, thereby nullifying any objections English speakers could have regarding French poetry's loftiness and strict poetic rules. Barzun's analysis of French poetic production of every age will enhance the lay reader's appreciation of French verse from Ronsard to the present.<br><i>- Bob Ivey, Memphis State Univ.

Each play includes an Introduction as well as an overview of Shakespeare&#x2019;s theatrical career; commentary on past and current productions based on interviews with leading directors, actors, and designers; scene-by-scene analysis; key facts about the work; a chronology of Shakespeare&#x2019;s life and times; and black-and-white illustrations. <br><br>Ideal for students, theater professionals, and general readers, these modern and accessible editions from the Royal Shakespeare Company set a new standard in Shakespearean literature for the twenty-first century.</p><p>William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in April 1564, and his birth is traditionally celebrated on April 23. The facts of his life, known from surviving documents, are sparse. He was one of eight children born to John Shakespeare, a merchant of some standing in his community. William probably went to the King&#x2019;s New School in Stratford, but he had no university education. In November 1582, at the age of eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, eight years his senior, who was pregnant with their first child, Susanna. She was born on May 26, 1583. Twins, a boy, Hamnet ( who would die at age eleven), and a girl, Judith, were born in 1585. By 1592 Shakespeare had gone to London working as an actor and already known as a playwright. A rival dramatist, Robert Greene, referred to him as &#x201c;an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers.&#x201d; Shakespeare became a principal shareholder and playwright of the successful acting troupe, the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men (later under James I, called the King&#x2019;s Men). In 1599 the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men built and occupied the Globe Theater in Southwark near the Thames River. Here many of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays were performed by the most famous actors of his time, including Richard Burbage, Will Kempe, and Robert Armin. In addition to his 37 plays, Shakespeare had a hand in others, including <i>Sir Thomas More</i> and <i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, and he wrote poems, including <i>Venus and Adonis</i> and <i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>. His 154 sonnets were published, probably without his authorization, in 1609. In 1611 or 1612 he gave up his lodgings in London and devoted more and more time to retirement in Stratford, though he continued writing such plays as <b>The Tempest</b> and <b>Henry VII</b> until about 1613. He died on April 23 1616, and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford. No collected edition of his plays was published during his life-time, but in 1623 two members of his acting company, John Heminges and Henry Condell, put together the great collection now called the First Folio.<i>Introduction<br></i><br><br>Shakespeare probably wrote <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> in 1606 or 1607; it was registered for publication on May 20, 1608, and apparently influenced a revision of Samuel Daniel&#x2019;s <i>Cleopatra</i> that was published &#x201c;newly altered&#x201d; in 1607. Antony and Cleopatra was thus roughly contemporary with <i>King Lear</i> and <i>Macbeth</i>. Yet the contrast between those two tragedies and Antony and Cleopatra is immense. Unlike <i>Macbeth</i>, with its taut focus on a murderer and his wife, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> moves back and forth across the Mediterranean in its epic survey of characters and events, bringing together the fates of Pompey, Octavius Caesar, Octavia, and Lepidus with those of the protagonists. <i>King Lear</i> gives proper names to fourteen characters, Macbeth to eighteen, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> to thirty-four. The Roman play requires no fewer than forty-two separate scenes, of which most occur in what modern editors label Acts 3 and 4, although no play is less suited to the classical rigors of five-act structure, and these divisions are not found in the reliable Folio text of 1623. Indeed, it is as though Shakespeare resolved at the height of his career to show that he could dispense entirely with the classical &#x201c;rules,&#x201d; which had never taken serious hold of the English popular stage in any case. The flouting of the unities is so extreme that John Dryden, in his <i>All for Love, or The World Well Lost </i>(1678), undertook not so much to revise Shakespeare as to start afresh on the same subject. Dryden&#x2019;s play is restricted to the last few hours of the protagonists&#x2019; lives, at Cleopatra&#x2019;s tomb in Alexandria, with a severely limited cast of characters and much of the narrative revealed through recollection. Although a substantial achievement in its own right, <i>All for Love</i> surely demonstrates that Shakespeare knew what he was doing, for Dryden has excised a good deal of the panorama, the excitement, and the &#x201c;infinite variety&#x201d; (2.2.246).<br><br>Shakespeare departs also from the somber tone of his tragedies of evil. He creates, instead, a world that bears affinities to the ambiguous conflicts of the other Roman plays, to the varying humorous perspectives of the comedies, and to the imaginative reconstructions of the late romances. As protagonists, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> lack tragic stature, or so it first appears: she is a tawny gypsy temptress and he a &#x201c;strumpet&#x2019;s fool,&#x201d; a once-great general now bound in &#x201c;strong Egyptian fetters&#x201d; and lost in &#x201c;dotage&#x201d; (1.1.13; 1.2.122&#x2014;3). Several scenes, especially those set in Egypt, are comic and delightfully bawdy: Charmian learning her fortune from the soothsayer, Cleopatra practicing her charms in vain to keep Antony from leaving Egypt or raunchily daydreaming of being Antony&#x2019;s horse &#x201c;to bear the weight of Antony&#x201d; (1.5.22), Cleopatra flying into a magnificent rage at the news of Antony&#x2019;s marriage to Octavia and then consoling herself with catty reflections on Octavia&#x2019;s reported low voice and shortness of stature (&#x201c;I think so, Charmian. Dull of tongue, and dwarfish,&#x201d; 3.3.17). In its comic texture, the play somewhat resembles <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, an earlier play about a younger pair of lovers, although there the bawdry is used chiefly to characterize the lovers&#x2019; companions and confidants, whereas in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> it is central to our vision of Cleopatra especially. In any case, the later play is a tragedy about lovers who, despite their quarrels and uncertainties and betrayals of self, are reconciled in a vision of the greatness of their love. In its depiction of two contrasting worlds, also, <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> recalls the movement of several earlier comedies from the realistic world of political conniving to a dream-world of the romantic and the unexpected. We can endorse neither world fully in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, and, accordingly, the vision of life presented is often ambivalent and ironic as much as it is tragic. The contrast of values separating Egypt and Rome underscores the paradox of humanity&#x2019;s quest for seemingly irreconcilable goals. The ending is neither a triumph nor a defeat for the lovers but something of both. If Antony and Cleopatra seem in one way too small to be tragic protagonists, in another way they seem too large, creating imaginative visions of themselves and their union that escape the realm of tragedy altogether. Our attention is focused less on the way in which the protagonists come to understand some meaningful relationship between their character and the fate required of them by a tragic universe than on the almost comic way in which the absurdities of Roman worldly striving and Egyptian dissipation are transfigured in the world of the imagination.<br><br>The Roman point of view opens the play and never entirely loses its force. At first, it may seem superior to that of Egypt. Demetrius and Philo, who invite us to view the play&#x2019;s first encounter between Antony and Cleopatra (1.1) from the perspective of the professional Roman soldier, lament the decline of Antony into Circean enslavement. Their tragic concept is of the Fall of Princes, all the more soberly edifying because of the height from which Antony has toppled. &#x201c;You shall see in him / The triple pillar of the world transformed / Into a strumpet&#x2019;s fool&#x201d; (1.1.11&#x2014;13). Egypt is enchanting but clearly enervating&#x2013;a bizarre assemblage of soothsayers, eunuchs, and waiting- gentlewomen who wish to be &#x201c;married to three kings in a forenoon and widow them all&#x201d; (1.2.28&#x2014;9). Their mirth is all bawdry, tinged with practices, such as transvestitism, that Roman custom views as licentious. The prevailing images are of procreation in various shapes, sleep (mandragora, Lethe), the oriental opulence of Cleopatra&#x2019;s barge (a golden poop, purple sails, silver oars, divers-colored fans), Epicurean feasting, and drinking. As Enobarbus says, &#x201c;Mine, and most of our fortunes tonight, shall be&#x2013;drunk to bed&#x201d; (1.2.47&#x2014;8).<br><br>Antony, for all his reckless defiance of Rome, agrees in his more reflective moments with what Demetrius and Philo have said. &#x201c;A Roman thought hath struck him,&#x201d; Cleopatra observantly remarks, and Antony has indeed determined that &#x201c;I must from this enchanting queen break off&#x201d; (1.2.88, 135). His later return to Cleopatra is at least in part a surrender, a betrayal of his marriage vows to Octavia and his political assurances to Caesar. In the ensuing battles, Antony submits himself dangerously to Cleopatra&#x2019;s governance, and this inversion of dominance in sexual roles, as conventionally understood by the Roman patriarchal world, is emblematic of a deeper disorder within Antony. As Enobarbus concludes bitterly, Antony &#x201c;would make his will / Lord of his reason&#x201d; and so has subverted his &#x201c;judgment&#x201d; (3.13.3&#x2014;4, 37) to passion.<br><br>From the beginning, Cleopatra has sought dominance over Antony in the war of the sexes. When Antony first came to her on the River Cydnus, we learn, he was so overcome in all his senses that he was &#x201c;barbered ten times o&#x2019;er&#x201d; (2.2.234). Cleopatra boasts that she &#x201c;angled&#x201d; for Antony on many occasions, catching him the way fishermen &#x201c;betray&#x201d; fish, and that, when she had &#x201c;drunk him to his bed,&#x201d; she &#x201c;put my tires and mantles on him, whilst / I wore his sword Philippan&#x201d; (2.5.10&#x2014;23). Caesar, affronted by such transvestite debauchery, charges that Antony &#x201c;is not more manlike / Than Cleopatra, nor the queen of Ptolemy / More womanly than he&#x201d; (1.4.5&#x2014;7). During the battle scenes, Antony&#x2019;s followers complain that &#x201c;Photinus, an eunuch&#x201d; (probably Mardian), and Cleopatra&#x2019;s maids manage the war: &#x201c;So our leader&#x2019;s led, / And we are women&#x2019;s men&#x201d; (3.7.14&#x2014;15, 70&#x2014;1). Antony confesses too late that they were right. He becomes a &#x201c;doting mallard,&#x201d; one whose heart is &#x201c;tied by th&#x2019; strings&#x201d; to Cleopatra&#x2019;s rudder when her ships retreat in the first naval engagement (3.10.20; 3.11.56). In the mythic images used to raise their relationship to heroic proportions, Antony is like Mars to Cleopatra&#x2019;s Venus (1.5.19), in both a positive and a negative sense. The image has positive connotations of the way in which, as Milton puts it, the &#x201c;two great sexes animate the world,&#x201d; the masterful soldier and his attractive consort complementing one another in a right relationship of martial prowess and beauty, bravery and love, reason and will; however, to the Renaissance, the myth of Mars and Venus could also be read in a destructive sense, as an adulterous relationship in which reason is subverted to appetite. In another mythic comparison, Antony is like Hercules, not in his prime, but with the shirt of Nessus on his back&#x2013;a poisoned shirt given to Hercules by his wife in a mistaken hope of thereby assuring his love for her (4.12.43). Antony&#x2019;s soldiers understandably believe that the god Hercules has deserted his reputed descendant and onetime champion (4.3.21&#x2014;2).<br><br>Despite Antony&#x2019;s shameful violation of manhood, honor, attention to duty, self-knowledge, and all that Rome stands for, however, the end of his story is anything but a one-sided endorsement for the Roman point of view. The actual Rome, disfigured by political conniving, falls far short of the ideal. Antony has a point when he protests that &#x201c;Kingdoms are clay&#x201d; (1.1.37). Alliances are unstable and are governed by mere political expediency. At first, Antony&#x2019;s wife Fulvia and his brother Lucius have fought one another until forced to unite against the greater threat of Octavius Caesar. Similarly, Antony and Caesar come together only because Pompey has become dangerously powerful at sea and has won the favor of the fickle mob, &#x201c;Our slippery people&#x201d; (1.2.192). This d�tente is not meant to last. As Enobarbus bluntly puts it, &#x201c;if you borrow one another&#x2019;s love for the instant, you may, when you hear no more words of Pompey, return it again&#x201d; (2.2.109&#x2014;11). Enobarbus is rebuked for his unstatesmanlike tone, but no one denies the validity of what he says. In this cynical negotiation, Octavia is a pawn between husband and brother, shabbily treated by both. Caesar coldly bargains away the happiness of the one person of whom he protests that &#x201c;no brother / Did ever love so dearly&#x201d; (2.2.159&#x2014;60). Antony, although hating false promises and resolving to be loyal to Octavia, knows within himself that it won&#x2019;t work. To make matters worse for the fair-minded Antony, he has received great favors from Pompey that he must now uncharitably repudiate in the interests of politics. Pompey does not miss the opportunity to remind Antony of his ingratitude, but the prevailing mood is not so much of bitterness as of ironic futility. Old friendships must be sacrificed; no one seems wholly to blame, and no one can stop the game. Pompey is as much in the wrong as anyone and as powerless. Despite his idealistic hope of restoring republican government to Rome, he has had to ally himself with pirates who offer him sinister temptations. He could be &#x201c;lord of all the world&#x201d; (2.7.62) if he would only murder on occasion, but Pompey is destined to be trapped between lofty ends and ignoble means. Lepidus is still another dismaying victim of political callousness, used condescendingly by Caesar and permitted to drink himself into oblivion, until he is cashiered on a trumped-up charge and imprisoned for life.<br><br>Octavius Caesar embodies most of all the ironic limits of political ambition. He has avoided enslavement to passion at the very real cost of enslaving himself to his public career as general, triumvir, and future emperor. His ideal warrior is one who, driven by military necessity, would &#x201c;drink / The stale [urine] of horses and the gilded puddle / Which beasts would cough at&#x201d; (1.4.62&#x2014;4). As a general, he is Antony&#x2019;s opposite in every way. He attacks only when he has the advantage and places those who have deserted Antony in his own front lines so &#x201c;That Antony may seem to spend his fury / Upon himself&#x201d; (4.6.10&#x2014;11). He controls his supplies cannily, believing it a &#x201c;waste&#x201d; to feast his army (4.1.17). He, of course, declines Antony&#x2019;s offers of single combat. Antony meantime recklessly accepts Caesar&#x2019;s challenge to fight at sea, feasts debauchingly in one &#x201c;gaudy night&#x201d; after another (3.13.186), and generously refuses to blame or penalize those who leave him. His sending Enobarbus&#x2019;s belongings after him into Caesar&#x2019;s camp convinces that honest soldier he has made a fatal error, for, however imprudent Antony&#x2019;s chivalry may be, it is unquestionably noble and great-hearted. Caesar is a superb general and political genius, but he is also a military automaton, a logistical reckoner, a Machiavellian pragmatist. In his personal life, he is no less austere and puritanical. He deplores loosening his tongue with alcohol. About women, he is deeply cynical, believing that &#x201c;want will perjure / The ne&#x2019;er-touched vestal&#x201d; (3.12.30&#x2014;1). Between him and Cleopatra, there is a profound antipathy, based in part on his revulsion at her earlier affair with his namesake and adoptive father, Julius Caesar (3.6.6). Cleopatra may entertain briefly the notion of trying to seduce this new Caesar (3.13.46 ff.), for like Charmian she loves long life &#x201c;better than figs&#x201d; (1.2.34), but, if so, she soon discovers that she and Caesar are not compatible. All that he represents she must instead grandly repudiate, choosing death and the fantasy of an eternity with Antony as her way to &#x201c;call great Caesar ass / Unpolicied&#x201d; (5.2.307&#x2014;8).</p><h2>Lost Illusions (Modern Library)</h2><p>"Balzac [was] the master unequalled in the art of painting humanity as it exists in modern society," wrote George Sand. "He searched and dared everything."<br><br>Written between 1837 and 1843, <b>Lost Illusions</b> reveals, perhaps better than any other of Balzac's ninety-two novels, the nature and scope of his genius. The story of Lucien Chardon, a young poet from Angoul�me who tries desperately to make a name for himself in Paris, is a brilliantly realistic and boldly satirical portrait of provincial manners and aristocratic life. Handsome and ambitious but na�ve, Lucien is patronized by the beau monde as represented by Madame de Bargeton and her cousin, the formidable Marquise d'Espard, only to be duped by them. Denied the social rank he thought would be his, Lucien discards his poetic aspirations and turns to hack journalism; his descent into Parisian low life ultimately leads to his own death.<br><br>"Balzac was both a greedy child and an indefatigable observer of a greedy age, at once a fantastic and a genius, yet possessing a simple core of common sense," noted V. S. Pritchett, one of his several biographers. Another, Andr� Maurois, concluded: "Balzac was by turns a saint, a criminal, an honest judge, a corrupt judge, a minister, a fob, a harlot, a duchess, and always a genius." <br><br>This Modern Library edition presents the translation by Kathleen Raine.</p><p><br>The Modern Library of the World's<br>Best Books<br><br>"All Balzac's characters are endowed with the zest for life with which he himself was animated. All his fabrications are<br> as intensely colored as dreams. From the highest ranks of the aristocracy to the lowest dregs of society, all the actors in his<br> Comedie are more eager for life, more energetic and cunning in their struggles, more patient in misfortune, more greedy in pleasure, more angelic in devotion than they are in the comedy of the real world. In a word, everyone in Balzac has genius....Every living soul is a weapon loaded to the very muzzle with will."<br><p><br></p><p>--Charles Baudelaire</p>Richard Howard is a Pultizer-Prize winning poet and translator.

He is one of Ireland's best known journalists. He is the author of <b>The South</b>, winner of the Irish Times/Aer Lingus Prize. In 1995, he was awarded the Academy of Arts and Letters E. M. Forster Prize. He is also the author of <b>The Heather Blazing</b> and <b>The Story of the Night</b>.It's hard to keep up with Irish literature, and it's difficult to take stock of; the backlist, as it were, shifts constantly, being a cultural tradition subject to the winds of politics and whatever a nation's self-image is at the moment. The continuing productivity of the Irish--and their diaspora--also contributes to the changing face of the overall accomplishment. So it is never redundant to refashion Irish literature--in this case, Irish fiction--and T?ib!n is an excellent choice, being an expert novelist (The Heather Blazing), a superb travel writer and historian (Homage to Barcelona) and young enough to be hip to the newest writers. His take on the Irish tradition is complex and bracing: it is, he says, "strangeness" itself. An awareness of the proximity of England and France makes the Irish writer aware of what is missing; and the three subjects that dominate Irish fiction are fire, men killing women, and fathers and sons. In his invaluable introduction, T?ib!n provides readers with a handy survey of writing in Ireland from the time of Swift till the latest by Colum McCann. In between, he includes selections from the standard-bearers (what to chose from Ulysses? The demotic Irish speechifying of "Cyclops"), from the lesser known and the unknown: John Broderick, from his beautiful The Trials of Father Dillingham; the funny Benedict Kiely. This is an exhaustive volume, and one with much variety. And its very last lines are apt, drawn from "Going Back," by Emma Donahue (b. 1969): "They wandered down the street past the restaurant, past the pub, coming to no conclusion. Like tails of a cloud, their voices winding around and in and out." Readers who wander into this long, big book will find conclusions perhaps hard to come by, but the Irish air is unmistakable.

Today, dramatic changes in the art world&#x2015;its increasing professionalization, the pervasive power of the art market, and fundamental shifts in art-making itself in our post-Duchampian era&#x2015;combined with a revolution in information technology, raise fundamental questions about the education of today's artists. <i>Art School</i><i>(Propositions for the 21st Century)</i> brings together more than thirty leading international artists and art educators to reconsider the practices of art education in academic, practical, ethical, and philosophical terms. The essays in the book range over continents, histories, traditions, experiments, and fantasies of education. Accompanying the essays are conversations with such prominent artist/educators as John Baldessari, Michael Craig-Martin, Hans Haacke, and Marina Abramovic, as well as questionnaire responses from a dozen important artists&#x2015;among them Mike Kelley, Ann Hamilton, Guillermo Kuitca, and Shirin Neshat&#x2015;about their own experiences as students. A fascinating analysis of the architecture of major historical art schools throughout the world looks at the relationship of the principles of their designs to the principles of the pedagogy practiced within their halls. And throughout the volume, attention is paid to new initiatives and proposals about what an art school can and should be in the twenty-first century&#x2015;and what it shouldn't be. No other book on the subject covers more of the questions concerning art education today or offers more insight into the pressures, challenges, risks, and opportunities for artists and art educators in the years ahead.</p><p><b>Contributors<br></b>Marina Abramovic, Dennis Adams, John Baldessari, Ute Meta Bauer, Daniel Birnbaum, Saskia Bos, Tania Bruguera, Luis Camnitzer, Michael Craig-Martin, Thierry de Duve, Cl�mentine Deliss, Charles Esche, Liam Gillick, Boris Groys, Hans Haacke, Ann Lauterbach, Ken Lum, Steven Henry Madoff, Brendan D.

With masterful erudition, Le Roy Ladurie deepens and expands the historical contexts of these accounts and, in the process, brings to life the customs, perceptions, and character of an age poised at the threshold of modernity.<br><br>"Le Roy Ladurie paints a remarkably contemporary picture of life in the sixteenth century. . . . It's a good story, told with a deft narrative touch."&#x2014;Michael S.

In and of themselves, the Platter men were intriguing fellows; the fact that they were also prolific writers, filling diaries, memoirs, and correspondence with the details of their lives, makes them a godsend to historians. Following the Platters' paper trail, Le Roy Ladurie fashions an engaging portrait of a remarkable family. Thomas Platter Sr., for example, started life as an unlettered shepherd, spent his childhood roaming central Europe in a gang of thieves and panhandlers, and managed to pick up both literacy and a trade in his travels. By turns a printer, landowner, healer, and teacher, Platter was the embodiment of a Renaissance man. His eldest son, Felix, became a well-respected doctor, as did his youngest surviving boy, Thomas Jr. <p> Using the private lives of the Platters, Le Roy Ladurie illuminates the dangerous times in which they lived. Martin Luther precipitated a violent religious reformation; brigands ran wild through the countryside, and medical students crept into graveyards by night to dig up newly buried bodies for dissection. On this wild ride into history, the author's insightful observations guide the reader unerringly through the customs, practices, and upheavals of the times.</p>From a wealth of vivid autobiographical writings, Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie reconstructs the extraordinary life of Thomas Platter and the lives of his sons as they crossed physical, political, and social boundaries in moving from peasantry to the professions of the new bourgeoisie. With masterful erudition, Le Roy Ladurie deepens and expands the historical contexts of these accounts and, in the process, brings to life the customs, perceptions, and character of the sixteenth century -- an age poised at the thresh-old of modernity.</p><h2>The Mathematics of Turfgrass Maintenance, 3rd Edition</h2><p>Loaded with helpful hints and easy-to-understand examples, this book covers the type of mathematical problems that face golf course superintendents every day.

His theoretical insights are grounded in an extended analysis of ship navigation&#x2015;its computational basis, its historical roots, its social organization, and the details of its implementation in actual practice aboard large ships. The result is an unusual interdisciplinary approach to cognition in culturally constituted activities outside the laboratory&#x2015;"in the wild."</p><p>Hutchins examines a set of phenomena that have fallen in the cracks between the established disciplines of psychology and anthropology, bringing to light a new set of relationships between culture and cognition. The standard view is that culture affects the cognition of individuals. Hutchins argues instead that cultural activity systems have cognitive properties of their own that are different from the cognitive properties of the individuals who participate in them. Each action for bringing a large naval vessel into port, for example, is informed by culture: the navigation team can be seen as a cognitive and computational system.</p><p>Introducing Navy life and work on the bridge, Hutchins makes a clear distinction between the cognitive properties of an individual and the cognitive properties of a system. In striking contrast to the usual laboratory tasks of research in cognitive science, he applies the principal metaphor of cognitive science&#x2015;cognition as computation (adopting David Marr's paradigm)&#x2015;to the navigation task. After comparing modern Western navigation with the method practiced in Micronesia, Hutchins explores the computational and cognitive properties of systems that are larger than an individual. He then turns to an analysis of learning or change in the organization of cognitive systems at several scales. Hutchins's conclusion illustrates the costs of ignoring the cultural nature of cognition, pointing to the ways in which contemporary cognitive science can be transformed by new meanings and interpretations.</p><p><i>A Bradford Book</i></p></p><p>Edwin Hutchins combines his background as an anthropologist and an open-ocean racing sailor in this account of how anthropological methods can be combined with cognitive theory to produce an new reading of cognitive science.

It is the only English translation of these books other than Heath?s out-of-print version which is a modernized retelling rather than a true translation. This 3rd Century BCE work displays astonishing virtuosity in the treatment of conic sections in the classical synthetic geometrical manner. It is the culmination of Greek geometry and, in turn, provided a basis for the work of modern mathematicians and scientists such as Vieta, Descartes, Kepler, and Newton. Includes many corrections to the old edition?s text, translation, and notes, all new diagrams, an index, a bibliography, and an introductory essay by Harvey Flaumenhaft. Design and layout make it easy to read and work with, with diagrams repeated on every spread, adequate space for notes, and high quality paper to prevent show-through.</p><p>Apollonius of Perga was probably born about 262 B.C.E. in Perga, on the southern coast of what is now Turkey.

He explores Paine's political and social ideas and the way he popularized them by pioneering a new form of political writing, using simple, direct language and addressing himself to a reading public far broader than previous writers had commanded. He shows which of Paine's views remained essentially fixed throughout his career, while directing attention to the ways his stance on social questions evolved under the pressure of events. This enduring work makes clear the tremendous impact Paine's writing exerted on the American Revolution, and suggests why he failed to have a similar impact during his career in revolutionary France. It also offers new insights into the nature and internal tensions of the republican outlook that helped to shape the Revolution. <br> In a new preface, Foner discusses the origins of this book and the influences of the 1960s and 1970s on its writing. He also looks at how Paine has been adopted by scholars and politicians of many stripes, and has even been called the patron saint of the Internet.</p><p>Eric Foner, DeWitt Clinton Professor of History, Columbia University.<br>"Dr. Foner has been extraordinarily successful in recognizing Tom Paine for the complex person that he was....The book not only treats Paine as a participant in two revolutions from a fresh point of view, but it relates the man and his ideas to mass movements and the aspirations of the laboring classes. [It] is sure to be recognized as an authoritative account of the shaping of Anglo-American radical ideology."--Richard B.

It provides them with the theoretical background to knowledgeably evaluate the many new ideas that emerge in the current literature, and in workshops and conferences. The purpose is to help leaders develop their own effective management style and approaches, and feel confident that their actions are informed by appropriate theory and knowledge of the latest research in the field.<br><br>Without theory, organizational leaders are forced to treat each problem that they encounter as unique&#x2013;as if it were a first-time occurrence. While leaders may have some experience with a particular issue, their solutions are usually not informed by the accumulated wisdom of others who have already encountered and resolved similar situations. <br><br>The authors approach the theory of the organization and administration of colleges and universities from three quite different perspectives, or paradigms, each relying on different assumptions about the &#x201c;reality&#x201d; of organizational life in colleges and universities. <br><br>The positivist paradigm&#x2013;primarily an omnibus systems theory&#x2013;integrates the chapters into a comprehensive, yet easily accessible whole. Social constructionism, the second paradigm, is introduced in each chapter to illuminate the difficulty of seeking and finding meaningful consensus on problems and policies, while also addressing important ethical issues that tend to be overlooked in leadership thought and action. The third paradigm, postmodernism, draws attention to difficulties of logic and communication under the constraints of strictly linear thinking that &#x201c;authorities&#x201d; at all levels attempt to impose on organizations.<br><br>This &#x201c;multiple paradigm&#x201d; approach enables readers to become more cognizant of their own assumptions, how they may differ from those of others in their organization, and how those differences may both create difficulties in resolving problems and expand the range of alternatives considered in organizational decision making. <br><br>The book offers readers the tools to balance the real-world needs to succeed in today&#x2019;s challenging and competitive environment with the social and ethical aspirations of all its stakeholders and society at large. The authors&#x2019; aim is to elucidate how administration can be made more efficient and effective through rational decision-making while also respecting humanistic values.

Goldsmith (1892-1964), a monumental teacher of practical mysticism, devoted most of his life to the discovery and teaching of spiritual principles which he founded and called &#34;The Infinite Way.&#34; After the publication of his seminal book, &#34;The Infinite Way,&#34; in 1947, Joel traveled throughout the world as a teacher and a healer.

Before ascending the pyre, she was expected to deliver both blessings and curses: blessings to guard her family and clan for many generations, and curses to prevent anyone from thwarting her desire to die. <em>Sati</em> also means blessing and curse in a broader sense. To those who revere it, <em>sati</em> symbolizes ultimate loyalty and self-sacrifice. It often figures near the core of a Hindu identity that feels embattled in a modern world. Yet to those who deplore it, <em>sati</em> is a curse, a violation of every woman's womanhood. It is murder mystified, and as such, the symbol of precisely what Hinduism should not be.<br><br>In this volume a group of leading scholars consider the many meanings of <em>sati</em>: in India and the West; in literature, art, and opera; in religion, psychology, economics, and politics. With contributors who are both Indian and American, this is a genuinely binational, postcolonial discussion.

There are plenty of recipes for those who like to try things for themselves, all properly tested by the author, who is a historic food consultant to TV and country house owners. The era begins with the near medieval styles of Henry VII and VIII, with special attention to Henry VIII&#x2019;s propagandizing banquets and feasts for foreign monarchs; progresses to the reign of Elizabeth, the effects of new foodstuffs from America, and treats some the great houses of the Tudor aristocracy; and finishes with the first two Stuart kings, James I and Charles I under whose rule we began to move towards a more modern style of cooking and when we also started to produce cookery books in large number.</p><p>Peter Brears is former Director of the Leeds City Museums and one of England&#x2019;s foremost authorities on domestic artifacts and historical kitchens and cooking technology.

The hearts-and-minds theory permeates not only most counterinsurgency books of the twenty-first century but &nbsp;the <i>U.S. Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual,</i> the U.S. military&#x2019;s foremost text on counterinsurgency. Mark Moyar assails this conventional wisdom, asserting that the key to counterinsurgency is selecting commanders who have superior leadership abilities. Whereas the hearts-and-minds school recommends allocating much labor and treasure to economic, social, and political reforms, Moyar advocates concentrating resources on security, civil administration, and leadership development.</p><p>Moyar presents a wide-ranging history of counterinsurgency, from the Civil War and Reconstruction to Afghanistan and Iraq, that draws on the historical record and interviews with hundreds of counterinsurgency veterans, including top leaders in today&#x2019;s armed forces. Through a series of case studies, Moyar identifies the ten critical attributes of counterinsurgency leadership and reveals why these attributes have been much more prevalent in some organizations than others. He explains how the U.S. military and America&#x2019;s allies in Afghanistan and Iraq should revamp their personnel systems in order to elevate more individuals with those attributes.</p><p><i>A Question of Command</i> will reshape the study and practice of counterinsurgency warfare. With counterinsurgency now one of the most pressing issues facing the United States, this book is a must-read for policymakers, military officers, and citizens.</p></p><p><b>Mark Moyar </b>is director of research at Orbis Operations and the author of <i>Triumph Forsaken: The Vietnam War, 1954&#x2013;1965</i> and <i>Phoenix and the Birds of Prey: Counterinsurgency and Counterterrorism in Vietnam.</i>"It is rare to read a book which combines academic excellence with such timely advice on a question of national importance....&nbsp;[Moyar's] perceptive analysis will have enduring value on both sides of the Atlantic for military commanders, policy-makers and historians alike." - General Sir David Richards, <i>RUSI Journal</i><br><br>"Moyar's study of Vietnam -- <i>Triumph Forsaken</i> -- is becoming a classic in counterinsurgency circles. His new case studies -- <i>A Question of Command</i> -- are making it to the desks of top military decision makers." - George Stephanopoulos, <i>ABC News</i><br>"By distancing himself from self-professed experts capable only of regurgitating thoughts and assertions made earlier and better... Moyar has done the impossible and provided a third course of action to all counterinsurgency professionals and practitioners." - Adam Strickland, <i>Small Wars Journal</i><br><br>"has attracted considerable attention in counterinsurgent circles.... now part of the curriculum in courses in Kabul." - C. J. Chivers, <i>New York Times</i><br><br><br>"In this important, well-written, and solidly researched work, respected historian Moyar adds to his impressive record of publication a thoughtful contribution to the counterinsurgency debate....

It teaches you how to create effective SQL queries to extract and update the data in an Oracle database. It teaches you how to design and implement a database, giving you insight into performance and security issues. It teaches you how to use PL/SQL to take advantage of powerful features like stored procedures, functions, and triggers. In short, it teaches you to create the kind of efficient database applications that make you a more effective and valuable developer.</p><p></p><p><b>Here are 5 of the ways that our book differs from the others</b></p><p><b>#1: You'll see how to take advantage of the Oracle SQL Developer tool</b><br>SQL Developer is a free tool for working with database objects and SQL statements. Its graphical interface makes it more intuitive and easier to use than older command-line tools like SQL*Plus. I think you ll find it boosts your productivity as you use it to write and run queries, to work with database objects, or to debug stored procedures.</p><p><b>#2: You'll start off with how to query a database, not how to design one</b><br>This book is written for application developers, and the first thing an application developer needs to know is how to write queries. So that's what's covered in the first 8 chapters of this book. It starts with simple queries, then moves on to complex inner and outer joins, summary queries, and subqueries that do more of the database processing so that your applications can do less.<br>Once you're comfortable with querying databases, this book shows how to design a database and how to create database tables. Having this background can help you query a database more effectively. And it provides a solid introduction to DBA skills if you're interested in that career path.</p><p><b>#3: You get 2 books in 1: A SQL book and a PL/SQL book</b><br>PL/SQL allows you to write complex scripts, stored procedures, functions, and triggers, all essential skills for most application developers. So along with SQL, this book covers the PL/SQL that you'll use most of the time; there's no need to buy a second book to learn PL/SQL.</p><p><b>#4: Complete applications show you how all the pieces interact</b><br>One key to mastering SQL is to have plenty of coding examples that show how the features you re learning work and what problems you may run into as you use them on your own. So this book provides dozens of SQL statements and PL/SQL scripts for various jobs that are routine in business applications. Download the examples for free from our website and use them as starting points for your own SQL routines.</p><p><b>#5: The paired-pages format lets you set your own pace</b><br>Depending on what you already know about Oracle SQL and how fast you want to go, you can read every page and study each example...skim through the headings for topics you don't know...scan through the righthand pages for development details you might have missed in the past...or turn to any two-page spread when you need reference information. The paired-pages format makes it easy and fast for you to use the book the way you want to.</p><p>(If you aren't familiar with how the paired pages work, please be sure to download a sample chapter from our website)</p></p><p>Joel Murach has a background in software training and is a specialist in developing business applications, particularly web applications.

What did Americans expect from it? What effects did the new daily ritual of watching television have on children? Was television welcomed as an unprecedented "window on the world," or as a "one-eyed monster" that would disrupt households and corrupt children?<br> <br> Drawing on an ambitious array of unconventional sources, from sitcom scripts to articles and advertisements in women's magazines, Spigel offers the fullest available account of the popular response to television in the postwar years. She chronicles the role of television as a focus for evolving debates on issues ranging from the ideal of the perfect family and changes in women's role within the household to new uses of domestic space. The arrival of television did more than turn the living room into a private theater: it offered a national stage on which to play out and resolve conflicts about the way Americans should live.<br> <br> Spigel chronicles this lively and contentious debate as it took place in the popular media. Of particular interest is her treatment of the way in which the phenomenon of television itself was constantly deliberated&#x2014;from how programs should be watched to where the set was placed to whether Mom, Dad, or kids should control the dial.<br> <br> <i>Make Room for TV</i> combines a powerful analysis of the growth of electronic culture with a nuanced social history of family life in postwar America, offering a provocative glimpse of the way television became the mirror of so many of America's hopes and fears and dreams.</p></p><p>Make Room For TV combines a powerful analysis of growth of electronic culture with a nuanced social history of family life in post war America, Offering a provocative glimpse of the way television became the focal point of so many of America&#39;s hopes and fears and dreams.This cultural history examines the postwar period, in which television was installed in nearly two-thirds of the nation's homes and replaced the movie theater as the primary source of entertainment. Spigel, who teaches at the University of Southern California's School of Cinema-TV, analyzes other popular media, such as women's magazines, to show the ambivalent societal responses to this new technology, which promised both to unite and separate families. Though filled with academic jargon, the book is a thoughtful treatment of a neglected really? aren't there dozens of books about dawn of TV age?/gen says there aren't many books on this topic so please stet/pk area of study, which may interest students of popular culture and perhaps trigger some nostalgia. Spigel places the television in the context of changing technology, suburbanization and a redefinition of leisure. Soap operas and variety shows were designed to accommodate the work pattern of housewives. Spigel argues that television not only intensified the retreat to suburbia but also provided a new form of community. Surveying television comedies, she suggests that they gave viewers the opportunity to laugh at staged domesticity, but at the same time to feel closer to the scene of the action, thus crossing the border between fiction and reality.

Later followed by Mark Twain&#x2019;s The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Story of a Bad Boy--once called the first truly American novel--is Aldrich&#x2019;s partially autobiographical tale of growing up in America. Set in Rivermouth (based on Aldrich&#x2019;s childhood home in Portsmouth, New Hampshire), it follows the exploits of young Tom Bailey through snowball wars, schoolyard fights, Fourth of July parades, adventures at sea, and childhood sweathearts.

But even in the Old Testament, the dual natures of sacrifice, embodying both ritual slaughter and moral rectitude, were at odds. In this analysis, Terry Eagleton makes a compelling argument that the idea of sacrifice has long been misunderstood.<br> &nbsp;<br> Pursuing the complex lineage of sacrifice in a lyrical discourse, Eagleton focuses on the Old and New Testaments, offering a virtuosic analysis of the crucifixion, while drawing together a host of philosophers, theologians, and texts&#x2014;from Hegel, Nietzsche, and Derrida to the <i>Aeneid </i>and <i>The Wings of the Dove</i>. Brilliant meditations on death and <i>eros</i>, Shakespeare and St. Paul, irony and hybridity explore the meaning of sacrifice in modernity, casting off misperceptions of barbarity to reconnect the radical idea to politics and revolution.</p><p>Terry Eagleton pursues the concept of sacrifice through the history of human thought, from antiquity to modernity, in religion, politics, and literature. He sheds skewed perceptions of the idea, honing in on a radical structural reconception that relates the ancient world to our own in terms of civilization and violence.<br> &nbsp;<b>Terry Eagleton</b> is Distinguished Visiting Professor of English Literature at Lancaster University, and the author of more than fifty books in the fields of literary theory, postmodernism, politics, ideology, and religion.</p><h2>Civics Today: Citizenship, Economics and You, Student Edition</h2><p><b>A civics program building the next generation of active Americans</b><br><br><i>Civics Today: Citizenship, Economics, and You</i> meets the content standards for civics and government as outlined by the National Standards for Civics and Government.<br><br>Many young citizens are completing their education with little or no sense of civic responsibility.

It went unreported.</p><p>January 1945: The outcome of World War II has been determined. The Third Reich is in free fall as the Russians close in from the east. Berlin plans an eleventh-hour exodus for the German civilians trapped in the Red Army's way. More than 10,000 women, children, sick, and elderly pack aboard the <i>Wilhelm Gustloff,</i> a former cruise ship. Soon after the ship leaves port and the passengers sigh in relief, three Soviet torpedoes strike it, inflicting catastrophic damage and throwing passengers into the frozen waters of the Baltic. </p><p>More than 9,400 perished in the night&#x2015;six times the number lost on the Titanic. Yet as the Cold War started no one wanted to acknowledge the sinking. Drawing on interviews with survivors, as well as the letters and diaries of those who perished, award-wining author Cathryn Prince reconstructs this forgotten moment in history. She weaves these personal narratives into a broader story, finally giving this WWII tragedy its rightful remembrance.</p></p><p>Cathryn J.

An engaging study of a shocking tragedy.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>&#x201c;If you think that the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i> was the worst maritime disaster ever, then you're wrong....Amazing and harrowing story, well written and documented.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jean-Paul Adriaansen, Water Street Bookstore</i></p><p>&#x201c;The sinking of the cruise liner that was once the pride of Hitler's Strength Through Joy program has long been overlooked by maritime historians. Yet when the <i>Wilhelm Gustloff</i> disappeared beneath the freezing waters of the Baltic in January of 1945, she took with her more than six times the number of people lost on the <i>Titanic</i>. Through careful research and interviews with the few remaining survivors. Cathryn J.

Prince recounts an important but little known aspect of World War II.

Out of a desire for vengeance and recognition, one Soviet submarine commander caused the deaths of thousands of refugees, deaths that the victors of World War II chose to ignore. Cathryn Prince breaks the silence around the devastation many German civilians suffered at the end of the war. Parting the curtain on the "collateral damage" the Allied Forces accepted as a necessary strategy for defeating Hitler, Death in the Baltic reveals that war's trauma spares no one.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Leila Levinson, award-winning author of Gated Grief</i></p><p>&#x201c;The story of the sinking of the <i>Willhelm Gustloff</i> is still unkown to a majority of non-Germans...It is certainly a grimly fascinating story, not least because of the wealth of human interest that it contains...Cathryn Prince tells the story of the Gustloff briskly and engagingly...making good use of the eyewitness accounts of the survivors&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>History Today</i></p></p><h2>Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St. Paul&#39;s School (The William G. Bowen Series, 65)</h2><p><p>As one of the most prestigious high schools in the nation, St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, has long been the exclusive domain of America's wealthiest sons. But times have changed. Today, a new elite of boys and girls is being molded at St. Paul's, one that reflects the hope of openness but also the persistence of inequality.</p><br><p> In <i>Privilege</i>, Shamus Khan returns to his alma mater to provide an inside look at an institution that has been the private realm of the elite for the past 150 years. He shows that St. Paul's students continue to learn what they always have--how to embody privilege. Yet, while students once leveraged the trappings of upper-class entitlement, family connections, and high culture, current St. Paul's students learn to succeed in a more diverse environment. To be the future leaders of a more democratic world, they must be at ease with everything from highbrow art to everyday life--from <i>Beowulf</i> to <i>Jaws</i>--and view hierarchies as ladders to scale. Through deft portrayals of the relationships among students, faculty, and staff, Khan shows how members of the new elite face the opening of society while still preserving the advantages that allow them to rule.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Privilege</i> is superb. Khan skillfully narrates from the perspective of both teacher and researcher, and the personal portraits are very well-rounded. This important book is a masterly look at a disturbing current in the formation of elite American society."<b>--Richard Sennett, author of <i>The Corrosion of Character</i></b></p><p>"This is a terrific book.

In this book a curator, an conservator, and two scientists use modern methods of examination to investigate exactly how these paintings were done and what materials were used. 76 illustrations; 208 color plates.</p><p>This is the third book in the "Art in the Making" series and a catalog for a recent show at London's National Gallery. Drawing on results of the scientific techniques used to probe beyond the observers' usual perceptions, the book also makes use of 19th-century light and color theory to explore the Impressionists' craft, from the arrangement of paint on the palette and the invention of tin paint tubes and flat ferrule brushes to the finishings of canvas linings and framing requirements. While the illustrations enhance the thesis--showing, among others, microscopic photography of brush strokes and materials employed--the text is uneven in its interpretation of Impressionist artists, especially Cezanne. (See John Rewald's Cezanne: A Biography , Abrams, 1986, to get a better background on the artist.) The book, however, is significant for its clarity and emphasis in debunking plein-air outdoor painting and providing a history of art suppliers, dealers, and exhibitions. The text corresponds to the bibliography and contains a glossary for those unfamiliar with the terms.

Through years of living with and learning about Native traditions across the continent, Joseph Epes Brown learned firsthand of the great diversity of the North American Indian cultures. Yet within this great multiplicity, he also noticed certain common themes that resonate within many Native traditions. These themes include a shared sense of time as cyclical rather than linear, a belief that landscapes are inhabited by spirits, a rich oral tradition, visual arts that emphasize the process of creation, a reciprocal relationship with the natural world, and the rituals that tie these themes together. Brown illustrates each of these themes with in-depth explorations of specific native cultures including Lakota, Navajo, Apache, Koyukon, and Ojibwe. <br> Brown was one of the first scholars to recognize that Native religions-rather than being relics of the past-are vital traditions that tribal members shape and adapt to meet both timeless and contemporary needs. <em>Teaching Spirits</em> reflects this view, using examples from the present as well as the past. For instance, when writing about Plains rituals, he describes not only building an impromptu sweat lodge in a Denver hotel room with Black Elk in the 1940s, but also the struggles of present-day Crow tribal members to balance Sun Dances and vision quests with nine-to-five jobs. <br>In this groundbreaking work, Brown suggests that Native American traditions demonstrate how all components of a culture can be interconnected-how the presence of the sacred can permeate all lifeways to such a degree that what we call religion is integrated into all of life's activities. Throughout the book, Brown draws on his extensive personal experience with Black Elk, who came to symbolize for many the richness of the imperiled native cultures. This volume brings to life the themes that resonate at the heart of Native American religious traditions.<br></p><p><br>The late <strong>Joseph Epes Brown</strong> was a professor of Religious Studies at the University of Montana. A renowned author in the fields of Native American Traditions and World Religions, Brown was one of the founders of Native American Studies and was largely responsible for bringing the study of Native American religious traditions into American higher education. His publications include <em>The Sacred Pipe</em> (1953), <em>Animals of the Soul</em> (1992), and <em>The Spiritual Legacy of the American Indian</em> (1982). <strong>Emily Cousins</strong>, a writer and editor, received a degree in Religious Studies and Art History from Harvard University. She coedited the new edition of Brown's Animals of the Soul and the forthcoming Honor Song, an anthology compiled in honor of Brown's work.<br><br>"A wonderful, clear synthesis-perhaps the best we have-of American Indian spiritual traditions, so precious and so illuminating, because they are not separate from land and life."--Peter Matthiessen, author of Tigers in the Snow<p></p><br>In this medicine bag of empathetic and insightful essay-lectures, the legacy of a preeminent scholar of American Indian religious traditions is opened for new generations of teachers and students. The late Joseph Brown was a legendary mentor, whose gentility and grace in person and on the page lent dignity and depth to the indigenous ways of knowledge and ceremony he passed on to others. Here we have Brown's thoughts on themes that preoccupied his scholarly and lecturing life: Indian concepts of time and space, language and song, animals and hunting and nature, and varieties of ritual practice. But Brown is always probing beneath these topics to a deeper, almost wordless realm, where he provokes us to ask how these American Indian ways of knowledge might, in turn, teach us to become more fully human. A long-awaited, marvelous inheritance. --Peter Nabokov, Department of World Arts and Cultures, UCLA<p></p><br></p><h2>The Oxford Companion to Irish Literature</h2><p>By turns sacred or profane, mystical or earthy, scathingly satirical and modern or achingly nostalgic for the ever-receding past, the literature of Ireland has long entranced and entertained readers the world over. Now <em>The Oxford Companion to Irish Literature</em> provides a comprehensive and delightfully readable guide to the evolution and achievements of Irish writers and writing across sixteen tumultuous centuries, from fourth-century <em>ogam</em> writing etched on ancient stones, to the towering twentieth-century figures of Yeats, Joyce, and Beckett, to the bold new voices emerging today as Ireland enters a new era and a new century.<br> Written by a distinguished team of writers from Ireland and around the world, this remarkable <em>Companion</em> offers over 2,000 entries that provide insight into the intimate fusion of history, literature, and culture that distinguishes so much of Ireland's poetry, drama, and fiction. Unrivalled in scope, this superb volume encompasses writing in both the Irish language and in English, across the religious and political spectrums, by native Irish and Anglo-Irish writers and such outsiders as Londoner Edmund Spenser, who completed <em>The Faerie Queen</em>--and indeed most of his life's work--during his two decades in Ireland. In contrast to other, less complete references, the editors of this <em>Companion</em> seek always to show the complex and continuing influence of the Irish language on writers in English, and vice versa. And as befits a country where so many writers have not only been commentators and observers of history but also active participants in the nation's affairs, there are dozens of entries on important historical events that shaped the lives and fired the imaginations of the Irish, from the Battle of the Boyne and the Great Famine of the 1840s, to the Easter Uprising of 1916 and today's continuing conflicts and controversies. Hundreds of biographical entries range from the early bards and authors such as Adaman, the seventh century abbot and biographer of the Irish saint Colum Cille, to contemporary writers such as Seamus Heaney, Brian Friel, and Booker Prize-winning novelist Roddy Doyle. The myriad contributions of Ireland's women writers also are well-represented here, with entries on folklorist and dramatist Lady Gregory, co-founder of Ireland's world-renowned Abbey Theatre, and many others, including the novelists and short story writers Mary Lavin, Elizabeth Bowen, Julia O'Faolain, Edna O'Brien and Maeve Binchy, and contemporary poets Eilean Ni Chuilleanain, Nuala Ni Dhomnaill, and Rita Ann Higgins.<br> Whether readers are seeking a quick introduction to the mythic figures of Cu Chulainn and the sidh, or fairy folk, who haunt the pages of Yeats's early poems, a handy who's who to the Dublin of Swift, Joyce, or Behan, or an invitation into the theatrical worlds of J.M. Synge or Sean O'Casey, <em>The</em> <em>Oxford Companion to Irish Literature</em> is a wonderfully accessible reference and an indispensable research tool. It will be treasured not only by students and scholars of Irish writing and history, but by anyone seeking a more acute understanding of one of the world's most vibrant literary traditions.<br></p><p>In over 2,000 entries, the Companion to Irish Literature surveys the Irish literary landscape across some sixteen centuries, describing its features and landmarks. Entries range from ogam writing, developed in the 4th century, to the fiction, poetry, and drama of the 1990s; and from Cu Chulainn to James Joyce. There are accounts of authors as early as Adamnan, 7th century Abbot of Iona, up to contemporary writers such as Roddy Doyle, Brian Friel, Seamus Heaney, and Edna O&#39;Brien; and individual entries on all major works, from Tain Bo Cuailngethe Ulster saga reflecting the Celtic Iron Age - to Swift&#39;s Gulliver&#39;s Travels, Edgeworth&#39;s Castle Rackrent, O Cadhain&#39;s Cre na Cille, and Banville&#39;s The Book of Evidence. It offers a wealth of information on general topics, ranging from the stage Irishman to Catholicism, Protestantism, the Irish language, and university education in Ireland; and on genres such as annals, bardic poetry, and folksong. The majority of entries include a succinct bibliography, and the volume also provides a chronology and maps. Throughout the Companion, cross-references give access to a network of interrelated topics, texts, and individuals, making it an ideal browsing book as well as a mine of information.<br><strong>Robert Welch</strong> is Professor of English at the University of Ulster, at Coleraine. <strong>Bruce Stewart</strong> lectures in Anglo-Irish Literary History and Bibliography.<br></p><h2>Weekend at Thrackley (British Library Crime Classics)</h2><p><p><strong>Mystery crime fiction written in the Golden Age of Murder</strong></p><p>"Bubbly social satire sets off a clockwork plot." <strong>&#x2015;<em>Booklist</em> STARRED review</strong></p><p><strong>'I'm taking a revolver to Thrackley.

But for those who can handle it, the unsurpassed beauty of the KJV will help them realize the marvelous beauty of the English language. And, of course, like the adults around them, they likely will have access to other more modern versions of the Bible. On the other hand, reading this Bible aloud to a child until they can read it on their own is a good idea, as the reading of any book is useful and a bonding experience-not to mention, the opportunity to explain theological concepts and situations in the narrative sections of the Bible as they occur.<p>"Features of this colorfully bound Bible with a cover of red, green, and yellow, as well as typeface in a dark blue, include a presentation page for personalizing the Bible as a gift; clear, 9-point type; words of Christ in red; 16 full-color charts and illustrations; book introductions; "Hide It in Your Heart" in-text memory verses; You Should Know"; in-text cameos of important "Bible People personalities; Parables and Miracles of the Bible; a Dictionary/concordance; and an 8-page full color map section. Also most helpful are eight pages interspersed throughout the text on heavier stock of pictures and diagrams with titles such as: What is the Bible? How the Bible was written down; Some Bible names and their meanings; People of the New Testament; and Four Gospels ... one life. The colorful contents alone will certainly appeal to any child.

First published in 1918, and set in Nebraska in the late 19th century, this tale of the spirited daughter of a Bohemian immigrant family planning to farm on the untamed land ("not a country at all but the material out of which countries are made") comes to us through the romantic eyes of Jim Burden. He is, at the time of their meeting, newly orphaned and arriving at his grandparents' neighboring farm on the same night her family strikes out to make good in their new country. Jim chooses the opening words of his recollections deliberately: "I first heard of �ntonia on what seemed to be an interminable journey across the great midland plain of North America," and it seems almost certain that readers of Cather's masterpiece will just as easily pinpoint the first time they heard of �ntonia and her world. It seems equally certain that they, too, will remember that moment as one of great light in an otherwise unremarkable trip through the world.<p> �ntonia, who, even as a grown woman somewhat downtrodden by circumstance and hard work, "had not lost the fire of life," lies at the center of almost every human condition that Cather's novel effortlessly untangles. She represents immigrant struggles with a foreign land and tongue, the restraints on women of the time (with which Cather was very much concerned), the more general desires for love, family, and companionship, and the great capacity for forbearance that marked the earliest settlers on the frontier.</p><p> As if all this humanity weren't enough, Cather paints her descriptions of the vastness of nature--the high, red grass, the road that "ran about like a wild thing," the endless wind on the plains--with strokes so vivid as to make us feel in our bones that we've just come in from a walk on that very terrain ourselves. As the story progresses, Jim goes off to the University in Lincoln to study Latin (later moving on to Harvard and eventually staying put on the East Coast in another neat encompassing of a stage in America's development) and learns Virgil's phrase "<i>Optima dies ... prima fugit</i>" that Cather uses as the novel's epigraph. "The best days are the first to flee"--this could be said equally of childhood and the earliest hours of this country in which the open land, much like <i>My �ntonia</i>, was nothing short of a rhapsody in prairie sky blue. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Professor Renfrew initiates an original synthesis between modern historical linguistics and the new archaeology of cultural process, boldly proclaiming that it is time to reconsider questions of language origins and what they imply about ethnic affiliation--issues seriously discredited by the racial theorists of the 1920s and 1930s and, as a result, largely neglected since. Challenging many familiar beliefs, he comes to a new and persuasive conclusion: that primitive forms of the Indo-European language were spoken across Europe some thousands of years earlier than has previously been assumed.</p><p>In this book Professor Renfrew directs remarkable new light on the links between archaeology and language, looking specifically at the puzzling similarities that are apparent across the Indo-European family of ancient languages, from Anatolia and Ancient Persia, across Europe and the Indian subcontinent, to regions as remote as Sinkiang in China.'Mr. Renfrew has written this fascinating book to review the subject in general and to advance a revisionist idea about the mode and timing of the Indo-European spread.'

Thomas D'Evelyn, Christian Science Monitor<br><br>'The argument is lively and lucid, and the book deserves a wide readership among specialists and non-specialists alike. It is a daring thesis ...

Richard Bradley, Nature</p><h2>History of Medicine: A Scandalously Short Introduction</h2><p><p>Jacalyn Duffin's History of Medicine provides a brief survey of the history of Western medicine with reference to recent scholarly literature and current issues in health care. Organized conceptually around the major fields of medical endeavour - anatomy, physiology, pathology, pharmacology, surgery, obstetrics, psychiatry, pediatrics, and family medicine - this book is an accessible overview of medical history as a vibrant component of social, intellectual, and cultural history, and as a research discipline in its own right.</p><p>Each chapter begins in antiquity and ends in the twentieth century. Throughout, Duffin shows that alternative interpretations can be found for most elements of our past and that topics of interest can go well beyond 'great men' and 'great discoveries' to include ideas, diseases, patients, institutions, and great mistakes. This approach does not mean that the 'great men' (and women) are neglected; rather they appear in context. Medical disasters such as chloramphenicol and thalidomide, are covered along with the triumphs, and examples from Canada's past, largely ignored in other medical histories, are included. A chapter on methodology, suggestions for further reading with special attention to Canadian sources, and a careful index make it possible to research a specific event or historical debate, or to satisfy a more general curiosity.</p><p>By presenting the material in a structure that resonates with the broad outlines of medical training, and by focusing on the questions asked most often, this text is a relevant guide for students to the history of the profession they are about to embrace, and for those who would teach them, be they physicians or historians. Duffin's clear and entertaining prose and the many illustrations will help to demystify medicine for general readers and for students in other domains, such as history, philosophy, and sociology.</p></p><p><p>'The facts she's unearthed are often fascinating and her prose is lively and accessible, guaranteeing interesting reading even for those on the receiving end of the stethoscope.'</p> <p>'History of Medicine is a tour de force, a very personal, enthusiastic, frank approach by a teacher, clinician, and historian who has excelled at all three, and brings that excellence and excitement to the students through these pages.'</p><b>Jacalyn Duffin</b> is a haematologist and historian who is Professor in the Hannah Chair of the History of Medicine at Queen's University.<p></p></p><h2>The Catholic Hipster Handbook: Rediscovering Cool Saints, Forgotten Prayers, and Other Weird but Sacred Stuff</h2><p><b>Winner of a 2019 Catholic Press Association Award: Backlist Beauty (First Place).</b><br> Being a Catholic Hipster is all about an attitude&#x2014;an attitude grounded in being part of a countercultural community of believers dedicated to something bigger than themselves in a world dominated by self-centeredness.

Using the familiar language of acting training, the book offers a method for the achievement of dreams through a five-year life and career plan giving positive steps to develop a happy life as an actor and as a person. It assists performers to flourish using the same kind of business/career planning that is a necessary part of life for entrepreneurs and business people. </p><p>This introduction to the acting industry provides essential knowledge not only for how the business actually works, but also describes what casting directors, agents, and managers do, demystifies the role of unions, discusses how much things cost, and offers advice on branding and marketing strategies. It differs from other such handbooks in that it addresses the everyday issues of life, money, and jobs that so frequently destroy an actor's career before it is even begun. </p><p>While addressing NYC and LA, the guide also gives a regional breakdown for those actors who may wish to begin careers or to settle in other cities. It is loaded with personal stories, and interviews with actors, casting directors, and agents from throughout the US. </p><p><i>The Actor's Business Plan </i>is the answer to the common complaint by students that they were not taught how to negotiate the show business world while at school.

An actor, like any other professional, needs career plans, which pretty much sums up the main message of this work by veteran actor, director/producer, and agent Brody. Individual chapters cover the development of a five-year plan to achieve one's goals, getting an agent, and trying to land a job in a desired theater. Also covered are topics such as taking coaching classes, trying out for roles, handling life-plan obstacles (e.g., student debt), and dealing with business expenses (e.g., headshots, union fees, relocation expenses, or health insurance), along with tips on how to make contacts and write query letters or resum�s. There is a section on what casting directors, agents, and managers actually do. The second half of the book focuses on the major acting centers of the country: Chicago, Minneapolis, New York, Los Angeles, Austin, Philadelphia, Atlanta, and the Washington, DC-Baltimore area. For each of these areas, the author provides a selection of agents, casting directors, photographers, drama schools, management, and theater companies with contact information.

He attended Jesuit schools and, in 1904, moved first to Trieste, then Paris, with Nora Barnacle; they married in 1931. After publishing his first novel, <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i>, in 1916, Joyce developed glaucoma, and his eyesight steadily diminished for the rest of his life. His seminal novel <i>Ulysses</i> was published by his friend Sylvia Beach out of her Paris bookstore, only to be banned in the US and elsewhere due to charges of indecency. Fleeing the Nazi invasion of France, Joyce died in Zurich in 1941.It would be difficult to overpraise this wonderful recording from Joyce&#39;s Dubliners. Setlock has a beautiful, subtly accented, fluid, flowing voice, a spritely voice, perfect for Joyce&#39;s spinsters and his drunks, the priests and little boys, the old politicians. Setlock does a superb job with the dialogue, with the incredible sensuality of Joyce&#39;s work, the telling detail, the moments of irretrievable loss. If one could change anything, it might be to slow him down slightly, the more to savour the words, but that would interfere with the flow and energy of Joyce&#39;s prose. E.J.M.

German film historian, mentor, and close friend Lotte Eisner was seriously ill and dying. Herzog was determined to prevent this and believed that an act of walking would keep Eisner from death. He took a jacket, a compass, and a duffel bag of the barest essentials, and wearing a pair of new boots, set off on a three-week pilgrimage from Munich to Paris through the deep chill and snowstorms of winter.</p><p><i>Of Walking in Ice</i> is Herzog&#x2019;s beautifully written, much-admired, yet often-overlooked diary account of that journey. Herzog documents everything he saw and felt on his quest to his friend&#x2019;s bedside, from poetic descriptions of the frozen landscape and harsh weather conditions to the necessity of finding shelter in vacant or abandoned houses and the intense loneliness of his solo excursion.<br><br> Includes, for the first time, Werner Herzog&#x2019;s 1982 &#x201c;Tribute to Lotte Eisner&#x201d; upon her receipt of the Helmut K�utner Prize</p><br></p><p><p>Werner Herzog has produced, written, and directed more than fifty films, including <i>Nosferatu the Vampyre; Aguirre, the Wrath of God; Fitzcarraldo</i>; and <i>Grizzly Man</i>. He grew up in a remote mountain village in Bavaria and now lives in Los Angeles, California.</p><p>"Herzog's existential journey through a hostile winter landscape is one of the great modern pilgrimages&#x2014;a record of physical suffering, of hallucination and ecstatic revelation, of portents and animals, of the wreckage of history and myth. <i>Of Walking in Ice</i> has the eerie power of the best fairytales. It hits you with the force of dreams and leaves you with the taste of snow-filled air."&#x2014;Helen Macdonald</p><p>"Surely the strangest, strongest walking book I know, it tells the story of a winter pilgrimage, made in desperation and in hope. At once a diary, a blizzard of weather and memories, and the record of a ritual: only Herzog could have written this weird, slender classic."&#x2014;Robert Macfarlane</p><p>"Herzog's pilgrimage is a fugue and an absurdist comedy as rich as anything in his cinema."&#x2014;Iain Sinclair</p><br><br><p>"A poetic rendering of a fraught and wild pilgrimage."&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>"Herzog&#x2019;s slight narrative is captivating because his experiences humanize the legendary filmmaker. He is full of curiosity and wonder. Even when he meanders into strange asides, Herzog remains interesting."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"Herzog&#x2019;s private dairy of his journey was first published four years later on. Titled <i>Of Walking in Ice</i>, it&#x2019;s now being reissued by the University of Minnesota Press. It is a weird and wonderful document&#x2014;a vital record of Herzog&#x2019;s creation of his famous, baffling self."&#x2014;<i>Slate</i></p><p>"Perversely compelling...Herzog&#x2019;s account begs to be read aloud."&#x2014;<i>New York Times</i></p><p>"<i>Of Walking in Ice</i> is not always particularly easy or pleasant to read. Nonetheless, Herzog&#x2019;s tortuous prose makes you feel his pain. The further you read, the more you feel the anguish of the repetitiveness of walking alone."&#x2014;<i>Full Stop</i></p><p>"You almost forget that Herzog must have been writing these entries at the end of the day, because of course he couldn&#x2019;t walk and experience and chronicle at the same time.

From 1896 to 1907, she created films for Gaumont in Paris. In 1907, she moved to the United States and established her own film company, Solax. From 1914 to 1920, Guy Blach� was an independent director for a number of film companies.&nbsp;Despite her immensely productive and creative career, Guy Blach�&#x2019;s indispensable contribution to film history has been overlooked. She entered the world of filmmaking at its nascent stage, when films were seen primarily as a medium in the service of science or as an adjunct to selling cameras. Working with Gaumont cameramen and cameras and the new technical advances for the projection of film, she became one of the film pioneers ushering in the new era of motion pictures as a narrative form. Written by cinema history experts and curators, this handsome volume brings to light a critical new mass of Guy Blach�&#x2019;s film oeuvre in an effort to restore her to her rightful place in film history.</p><p><b>Joan Simon</b> is Curator-At-Large for the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, New York. <b>Jane Gaines</b> is Professor of Film in the School of the Arts at Columbia University, New York, New York. <b>Alison McMahan</b> is a writer, filmmaker, and president of Homunculus Productions, a company that produces training films, industrials, and documentaries. <b>Charles Musser</b> is Professor of American Studies, Film Studies, and Theater Studies at Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut. <b>Kim Tomadjoglou</b> is Preservation Consultant for the present exhibition, <i>Alice Guy Blach�: Cinema Pioneer.</i> She is an independent consultant, film programmer, and preservation advisor for the Women and Film History International Project. <b>Alan Williams</b> is Professor of French and Cinema Studies at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey.</p><h2>Developing The Leaders Around You (How To Help Others Reach Their Full Potential)</h2><p><p>In this bestseller, John Maxwell examines the differences between leadership styles, outlines principles for inspiring, motivating, and influencing others.

Ammann</h2><p>Ammann was born and educated in Switzerland, emigrated to New York in 1904, and hit his professional stride at a time when the City desperately needed a series of arterial bridges to knit together its boroughs and to connect them with neighboring states.This is the first book to examine Ammann&#39;s life and work; it is also a summary account of the technology embodied in the long-span bridges and the role they played in regional planning initiatives undertaken in the Tri-State area between the 1920s and the 1960s. Ammann was also the designer of many other projects, including the Lincoln Tunnel, the Delaware Memorial Bridge, and a bridge across Lake Geneva that was never built. He is often mistaken as the designer/engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge, and perhaps would have been if he hadn&#39;t lacked an engineering license for California.</p><p>Darl Rastorfer is director of Projects in the Design Arts, Inc., a New York-based nonprofit educational organisation. He is curator for the Cooper Hewitt Museum exhibition Six Bridges: The Making of the New York Megalopolis that is showing in galleries across the United States."It is a crime to build an ugly bridge," said Othmar Ammann, and the first span he built as an independent engineer, New York's George Washington Bridge, was among the elegant bridges recounted in Henry Petroski's fine <i>Engineers of Dreams</i> (1995). This handsome album summarizes Ammann's career and exhibits 200 photographs and design drawings of his principal achievements: the GW Bridge, the Bronx-Whitestone Bridge, the Throgs Neck Bridge, the Triborough Bridge, the Bayonne Bridge, and the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Rastorfer's text provides the political context (especially the muscle of public works czar Robert Moses) surrounding the creation of these distinctive elements of New York's skyline, but Rastorfer is more enthused about Ammann's management of these bridges' construction and his contribution to their unique engineering elements and overall aesthetic. The black-and-white images exalt the artistic aspects of the bridges, proclaiming their beauty and vitality to the life of the city, while commemorating their immigrant Swiss designer. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>Hano: The Tewa Indian Community in Arizona</h2><p>This case study provides a look at Pueblo life as well as the historical forces which shaped the Pueblo communities of today.

These behaviors, which appear meaningless, unproductive, or even dangerous, can be changed or stopped. <p> This guide describes functional behavior assessment (FBA), a highly regarded strategy that parents and professionals can use to identify the factors contributing to the problem behavior. As the book explains, children and adults with ASDs are susceptible to unwanted behaviors due to difficulties with communication skills, social skills, and narrow interests. For example, a nonverbal adult engages in head-banging to obtain beads reserved for times when he needs calming; a child with social skills deficits inappropriately seeks attention by hitting classmates; or an adolescent hyperfocused on one tv program irritates everyone by constantly talking about it. An FBA helps to determine what purpose the behavior serves for the individual and the specific circumstances that led to learning the behavior in the first place. Later on, the assessment is used to develop an intervention plan to help the individual unlearn the behavior.</p><p> Anyone can learn the basics of FBA. The book's step-by-step explanations, forms, and case studies make it easy for parents and professionals to:</p><ul> <li>Decide which challenging behavior to address</li> <li>Select members of an FBA team</li> <li>Measure behavior</li> <li>Gather information from other observers</li> <li>Establish a baseline</li> <li>Observe a problem behavior</li> <li>Test the hypothesis about the function of the behavior</li> <li>Begin to plan for an intervention</li> <li>Troubleshoot</li></ul> With <b>Functional Behavior Assessment for People with Autism</b> caregivers are well on the way to breaking down the barriers created by challenging behavior.

Text and detailed drawings follow the planning and construction of a &#34;&#34;typical&#34;&#34; castle and adjoining town in 13th-century Wales.</p><p>Imagine yourself in 13th-century England. King Edward I has just named the fictitious Kevin le Strange to be the Lord of Aberwyvern--"a rich but rebellious area of Northwest Wales." Lord Kevin's first task is to oversee the construction of a strategically placed castle and town in order to assure that England can "dominate the Welsh once and for all." And a story is born! In the Caldecott Honor Book <i>Castle</i>, David Macaulay--author, illustrator, former architect and teacher--sets his sights on the creation and destiny of Lord Kevin's magnificent castle perched on a bluff overlooking the sea. Brick by brick, tool by tool, worker by worker, we witness the methodical construction of a castle through exquisitely detailed pen-and-ink illustrations. Children who love to know how things work especially appreciate Macaulay's passion for process and engineering. Moats, arrow loops, plumbing, dungeons, and weaponry are all explained in satisfying detail. This talented author also has a keen sense of irony and tragedy, which is played out in the intricacies of the human story: a castle can be built as a fortress, but ultimately it becomes obsolete when humans discover that cooperation works best.

Our land is topped and tailed with flames. Beyond the frontier ditches of our fields and in the shelter of our woods, on common ground, where yesterday there wasn't anyone who could give rise to smoke, some newcomers, by the luster of an obliging reapers' moon, have put up their hut--four rough and ready walls, a bit of roof--and lit the more outlying of these fires. Their fire is damp. They will have thrown on wet greenery in order to procure the blackest plume, and thereby not be missed by us. It rises in a column that hardly bends or thins until it clears the canopies. It says, New neighbors have arrived; they've built a place; they've laid a hearth; they know the custom and the law. This first smoke has given them the right to stay. We'll see.<br><br>But it is the second twist of gray that calls us close, that has us rushing early from our homes on this rest day toward Master Kent's house. From a distance this smoke is pale. No one has added greenery to darken it. But the blaze itself is less faint-hearted. It is rackety. It is a timber fire, for sure. But ancient wood. Long-felled. The years are in its smell. We fear it is the manor house that burns and that we will be blamed for sleeping through. We'd best prepare excuses now. So, if we heard the cracking of its rafters and its beams in our slumbers this morning, we must have mistaken it for the usual busying of trees and wind, or for the toiling of dreams, or for the groaning of our bones. Yesterday was harvest end, the final sheaf. We were expecting to sleep long and late this morning, with heavy shoulders naturally but with buoyant hearts. Our happiness has deafened us, we'll say. It was only when we heard Willowjack, the master's fancy sorrel mare, protesting at the smoke with such alarm, that we awoke and went to help, as help we must, for no one wants to lose the manor house.<br><br>Now that we have reached our master's paddocks and his garths, we can smell and taste the straw. The smoke and flames are coming not from his home but from his hay lofts and his stable roofs. His pretty, painted dovecote has already gone. We expect to spot his home-birds' snowy wings against the smoke-gray sky. But there are none.<br><br>I know at once whom we should blame. When Christopher and Thomas Derby, our only twins, and Brooker Higgs came back from wooding last evening, they seemed a little too well satisfied, but they weren't bringing with them any fowl or rabbit for the pot, or even any fuel. Their only spoils, so far as I could tell, were a bulky, almost weightless sack and immodest fits of laughter. They'd been mushrooming. And by the looks of them they had already eaten raw some of the fairy caps they'd found. I did the same myself in my first summer of settlement here, a dozen or so years ago, when I was greener and less timid, though not young. I remember eating them. They are beyond forgetting. Just as yesterday, the last sheaf of that year's harvest had been cut and stood. And, just as today, we'd faced a break from labor, which meant that I could sleep my mischief off. So in the company of John Carr, my new neighbor then, my neighbor still, I went off that afternoon to Thank the Lord for His Munificence by hunting fairy caps in these same woods. I'll not forget the dancing lights, the rippling and the merriment, the halos and the melting trails that followed anything that moved, the enormous fearlessness I felt, the lasting fear (yes, even now), or how darkly blue the moon became that night, and then how red. I wish I'd had the courage since to try to find that moon again.<br><br>Last evening, when the twins and Brooker Higgs jaunted past our cottages and waved at us with gill stains on their fingertips, I asked these merry men, "Had any luck?" They bared their sack of spoils at once, because they were too foxed and stupefied to conceal them, even though they understood my ancient closeness to the manor house. I pulled aside the dampening of leaves and inspected their few remaining fairy caps, saved for later revels, I suppose, plus a good number of golden shawls, which, stewed in milk and placed inside a dead man's mouth, are meant to taste so good they'll jolt him back to life. Accounting for the bulk of their sack was a giant moonball, its soft, kid-leather skin already smoking spores, and far too yellowy and dry to cook. Why had they picked it, then? Why hadn't they just given it a satisfying kick? What kind of wayward lads were these?<br><br>Here's what took place. This is my reckoning, calculated without recourse to any constable or magistrate--and just as well, because this place is too far off from towns to number such judicious creatures among our livestock; we are too small, and getting smaller. Our final day of harvesting was not as joyful as it ought to have been, and not only because the crop proved so frugal in the ear. A gentleman we did not recognize was watching us reduce our barley field to stub; a visitor, a rare event, exciting and unnerving. We mowed with scythes; he worked with brushes and with quills. He was recording us, he said, or more exactly marking down our land, at Master Kent's request. He tipped his drawing board for anyone that asked and let them see the scratchings on his chart, the geometrics that he said were fields and woods, the squares that stood for cottages, the ponds, the lanes, the foresting.<br><br>He was a pleasant man, I'd say. No more than thirty years of age and dressed much like the master, not for labor but for the open air, in sturdy boots, breeches, a jerkin, and a plain cap without feather, brooch or badge. His beard was shaped and honed to a point with wax. I have a narrow trowel that matches it. A townsman's beard. A wealthy beard. And he was lopsided when he moved, with a stiff arm and shoulder on his left. His was a body not well suited to the balks and bumpy edges of a field. He was a stumbler. And there was, I thought, a trace of past illness in his expression as well as in his step. But I've never seen a man more ready with a smile. We could not help but stare at him and wonder, without saying so, if those scratchings on his board might scratch us too, in some unwelcome way.<br><br>Still, there was essential work to finish yesterday, whatever our distractions. If we hoped for sufficient grain to last the year, we'd have to deserve it with some sweat. This summer's yield was not yet good enough. Plenty, here, has wed itself to Leanness. At the lower, shaded limits by the dell and on the more neglected stony slopes our plants have proven miserly. They grew as short, askew and weakly as our limping visitor and so were hardly worth the reaping. But the higher field, which we left standing till the last, has always looked more sprightly--and more promising. Since spring we've waited with our fingers crossed as our better barley steadily renounced its green and let itself go tawny. From the lane, looking down toward the tracery of willows on the brook, the top end of our barley meadow, bristling and shivering on the breeze, showed us at last its ochers and its cadmiums, its ambers and its chromes. And the smells, which for so long in this slow summer were faint and damp, became nutlike and sugary. They promised winter ales and porridges. The awns and whiskers of the barley's ears were brittle and dry enough to chit-chat-chit every time they were disturbed, nattering with ten thousand voices at every effort of the wind or every scarper of a rabbit, mouse or bird. They said, "We've had enough. Our heads are baked and heavy now. We're dry. Bring out your blades and do your worst."<br><br>Reap and gossip. That's the rule. On harvest days, anyone who's got a pair of legs and arms can expect to earn supper with unceasing labor. Our numbers have been too reduced of late to allow a single useful soul to stay away. There's not a hand that will escape the brittle straw unscratched. The children go ahead of us, looking for the gray of any thistle heads that have outstripped our rust-gold barley, then duck below the level ears of grain to weed out nettles, teasels, docks; "dealing with the grievances," we say. The broadest shoulders swing their sickles and their scythes at the brimming cliffs of stalk; hares, partridges and sparrows flee before the blades; our wives and daughters bundle up and bind the sheaves, though not too carefully--they work on the principle of ten for the commons and one for the gleaning; our creaking fathers make the lines of stooks; the sun begins to dry what we have harvested. Our work is consecrated by the sun. Compared to winter days, let's say, or digging days, it's satisfying work, made all the more so by the company we keep, for on such days all the faces we know and love (as well as those I know but do not like entirely) are gathered in one space and bounded by common ditches and collective hopes. If, perhaps, we hear a barking deer nagging to be trapped and stewed, or a woodcock begging to make his hearse in a pie, we lift our heads as one and look toward the woods as one; we straighten up as one and stare at the sun, reprovingly, if it's been darkened by a cloud; our scythes and hand tools clack and chat in unison. And anything we say is heard by everyone. So there is openness and jollity.<br><br>The harvest teamwork allows us to be lewd. Our humor ripens as the barley falls. It's safe to spread the gossip noisily, it's safe to bait and goad, Who's sharing wives? Which bearded bachelor is far too friendly with his goat? Which widower (they look at me) has dipped his thumb in someone else's pot? Which blushing youngsters are the village spares, that's to say those children who've been conceived in one man's bed and then delivered in another's? Who's making love to apple tubs? Who's wedded to a sack of grain? Nothing is beyond our bounds, when we are cutting corn.<br><br>So it was hardly a surprise yesterday that once "Mr. Quill" in Master Kent's close company was attending with his survey sticks and measuring tapes to the shape and volume of our fallow field and so beyond hearing, we wondered, out loud, whether our visiting townsman had ever overcome his undisguised deficiencies to secure himself a willing wife. Was he a husband yet? And, if he was, what blushing pleasures might Mistress Quill take from such staggering and stiffness and from having such a likeness of her hairy private part upon her stumbling lover's chin? "I'd like to take a scythe to him," said my neighbor John. Another said, "I'd rather take my wooden staff to her." And then of course the bawdiness increased with such play on the prospect of caressing Mr. Quill's three-cornered beard and Mistress Quill's twin attribute that every time that evening and in our company he ruminated with his hand around his chin, as was his habit, the women there could barely plug their grins while their men looked on, biting their lips. "And have you noticed his white hands?" one of our village daughters asked. "I wonder if he's ever dirtied them . . . other than to . . ." No, she would not finish. What she had in mind did not seem possible.<br><br>It was only when the gentleman returned in the fullness of the afternoon and stood at our backs on the bristle of the field to quantify and measure us that we began again to wonder what awaited these treasured neighborhoods and to feel uneasy. What was he wanting from our soil, what were his charts securing? We saw his finger wagging on the count. We heard him numbering, until he reached the paltry fifty-eight that represented us. We know enough to understand that in the greater world, flour, meat and cheese are not divided into shares and portions for the larder, as they are here, but only weighed and sized for selling. Was Mr. Quill the confirmation of the rumor that had gone about our doors that Master Kent was in such narrows now he was a widower that he would need to measure and sell our land? No amount of openness and jollity could raise our spirits once that fear took hold. Our observer's ready smile was menacing.<br><br>We were slow to broadcast our alarm. But we tackled our last barley stands more silently, less lewdly--and more scrupulously, as we were being watched. Now each barking deer or woodcock call was a warning. Each darkling cloud reminded us how nothing in our fields was guaranteed. We only muttered to ourselves, too anxious to raise our voices loud enough to reach our neighbors down the reaping line. Some of the younger men set faces which declared they'd defend our acres with their lives or with the lives of anyone that crossed them. The usual silent swagger. Rather than speak up, they turned their anger on the pigeons and the rooks, and on a handful of our master's near-white doves, which had descended on the stub and were already robbing fallen grain that, by ancient gleaning rights, should have been ours. These "snowy devils," their out-of-season whiteness making them seem even more coldly pea-eyed and acquisitive than their gray and black companions, were feasting on our bread and ale, they said, and sent the children to use their slings or shower them with handfuls of grit or yell the thieves away, anything to evidence our tenancy. The air was full of wings and cries. So our final harvesting gained ground.<br><br>By my account, once our complicated working day was done and all our flat-eared barley was gathered in and carted away, the Derby twins and Brooker Higgs, unmarried men in a village dismayingly short of unmarried women, set off for the woods, while most of us, the rest of us, restored ourselves at home, took stock. We shook our heads and searched our hearts, until we had persuaded ourselves that Master Kent was too good and just a man to sell our fields. He'd always taken care of us. We'd always taken care of him. Besides, what was the evidence of any sale? A bearded, skew-whiff gentleman? A chart? The counting of our heads? No, we should not be mistrustful. We should face the rest day with easy hearts, and then enjoy the gleaning that would follow it, with our own Gleaning Queen the first to bend and pick a grain. We should expect our seasons to unfold in all their usual sequences, and so on through the harvests and the years. Everything was bound to keep its shape. That's what we thought.

It was, as Elliott West shows, a tale of courage and ingenuity, of desperate struggle and shattered hope, of short-sighted government action and a doomed flight to freedom. <br><br>To tell the story, West begins with the early history of the Nez Perce and their years of friendly relations with white settlers. In an initial treaty, the Nez Perce were promised a large part of their ancestral homeland, but the discovery of gold led to a stampede of settlement within the Nez Perce land. Numerous injustices at the hands of the US government combined with the settlers' invasion to provoke this most accomodating of tribes to war. West offers a riveting account of what came next: the harrowing flight of 800 Nez Perce, including many women, children and elderly, across 1500 miles of mountainous and difficult terrain. He gives a full reckoning of the campaigns and battles--and the unexpected turns, brilliant stratagems, and grand heroism that occurred along the way. And he brings to life the complex characters from both sides of the conflict, including cavalrymen, officers, politicians, and--at the center of it all--the Nez Perce themselves (the <em>Nimiipuu</em>, "true people"). The book sheds light on the war's legacy, including the near sainthood that was bestowed upon Chief Joseph, whose speech of surrender, "I will fight no more forever," became as celebrated as the Gettysburg Address. <br><br>Based on a rich cache of historical documents, from government and military records to contemporary interviews and newspaper reports, <em>The Last Indian War</em> offers a searing portrait of a moment when the American identity--who was and who was not a citizen--was being forged.</p><p><br><strong>Elliott West</strong> is Professor of American History at the University of Arkansas.<br>"No one writes Western history better than Elliott West. Here he puts the Nez Perce story into the broad context of U.S. national integration while retaining its vivid specificity. A gripping account for both academic and general audiences."--Daniel Walker Howe, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815-1848<br> "In Elliott West's skilled hands, the plangent tale of Chief Joseph and the great hegira of his people comes to immediate life on the page." --Hampton Sides, author of Blood and Thunder<br> "Powerful and elegant, informative and highly readable, Elliott West's The Last Indian War is one of the most distinguished works on its subject to appear in 30 years. Its core is a fascinating account of how some 800 Nez Perce outwitted the U.S. Army over a 1500-mile retreat. Indians and white army officers, soldiers, politicians and local settlers-all become flesh and blood, revealing not only West's profound understanding of Indian culture but his ability to put them within the context our national history as it was becoming a modern industrial nation."--Howard R. Lamar, Sterling Professor Emeritus of History, Yale University<br> "With his extraordinary gifts for conveying the character of the people of the past and for untangling--but never over-simplifying--the most complex of stories, Elliott West uncovers the unifying patterns in the Civil War and the Indian Wars, the Reconstruction of the South and the incorporation of the West."--Patricia Nelson Limerick, Center of the American West, University of Colorado<br> "No one has ever told the story of the Nez Perce so compellingly and so movingly-and many have told it. Even moreimpressively, West makes this wry, tragic, and deeply humane volume a window onto the wider changes transforming the United States. His idea of a Greater Reconstruction provides a framework for future histories of the era."--Richard White, Professor of History, Stanford University<br> "In West's sweeping narrative, the destinies of Nez Perce warriors and American officers entwine as they struggle for mastery of some of the continent's choice land. In the hands of one of our greatest western historians, the last Indian war is no longer an isolated event on the edge of American history, but goes to the heart of the central question of just who was welcome in modern America, and under what terms."--Heather Cox Richardson, author of West From Appomattox<br> "The Nez Perces never wanted war and their history was embedded in the glorious and forbidding geography of the high country of Idaho and Montana for a millennia. Elliott West, one of the most versatile and distinguished historians of the American West, tells this riveting epic story of land, greed, race, and warfare. All whites are not villains and all Indians are not heroic in this saga; but the tragedy of the pursuit and destruction of Chief Joseph and his people by the relentless logic of war is rooted in a U.S. government policy of conquest and racial dominance that we must still reckon with today.

Ellen has continued her lifelong commitment to health and wellness through board representation, event organization, and fundraising, most recently for the Obama campaign. In May she was invited to The First Lady's Mother's Day Tea at the White House, where Michelle Obama said she needed a copy of the book <i>now,</i> and served on the Host Committee for DNC Women's Leadership Forum. Ellen is a founding member of Fresh Start Women's Foundation and currently serves on the Community Advisory Board of Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla. <strong>Jack Dolgen</strong> is a writer, musician and creative entrepreneur who lives in LA. While Ellen Dolgen is the charismatic, relatable spokesperson for Shmirshky, she and Jack are a memorably funny duo and backstory to the book.Penned with her son, Jack Dolgen, the authors arrive with an entertaining and informative account of the surprises that await the woman reaching menopause. While many writers approach the topic with reservations, or don't approach it at all, E uses word creation, substitutions, and abbreviations to add a fun factor to the sticky, often embarrassing terms. Not only does E keep the book free of filler but she also includes the practical information about menopause that many women will want to know, including instances of depression and sleeplessness, and practical advice on the importance of getting a thyroid checkup and hormone level testing. Pocked with footnotes, charts, a mini dictionary, and further reading advice, E approaches her subject like the enthusiastic leader of a self-help seminar. And anecdotes sharing the disparate menopausal experiences of E's friends and acquaintances add to the book's charm. E tackles her topic with grace, humor, and a youthful but knowledgeable attitude. By intertwining guidance and jest, she's created an unexpected page-turner. <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

For the past fifteen years he has taught at middle schools in the San Francisco Bay area and in Texas. Rick lives in San Antonio, Texas, with his wife and two sons. Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief was Rick&#39;s first novel featuring the heroic young demi-god. It was also the overall winner of the Red House Childrens&#39; Book Award in 2006.Sounding alternately young, or old, or really scary, Jesse Bernstein narrates the third installment of the adventures of teenaged demi-god Percy Jackson and his friends. Facing the potential destruction of Mount Olympus by an ancient monster, Percy teams up with a group of Artemis&#39;s hunters to rescue the goddess, and save his friend Annabeth along the way. But their quest seems doomed from the beginning, and Bernstein effectively voices the confusion and loss the team experiences. This book is tied closely to the preceding books in the Olympians series; thus, some story lines are understood better with background.

On the eve of the battle, a cross appeared to him in the sky with an exhortation, &#34;By this sign conquer.&#34; Inscribing the cross on the shields of his soldiers, Constantine drove his rivals into the Tiber and claimed the imperial capital for himself. Under Constantine, Christianity emerged from the shadows, its adherents no longer persecuted. Constantine united the western and eastern halves of the Roman Empire. He founded a new capital city, Constantinople. Thereafter the Christian Roman Empire endured in the East, while Rome itself fell to the barbarian hordes. Paul Stephenson offers a nuanced and deeply satisfying account of a man whose cultural and spiritual renewal of the Roman Empire gave birth to the idea of a unified Christian Europe underpinned by a commitment to religious tolerance.</p><p>Paul Stephenson is a professor of history at Durham University and a specialist in the early and middle Byzantine periods. His publications include The Legend of Basil the Bulgar-slayer and Byzantium&#x2019;s Balkan Frontier: A Political Study of the Northern Balkans, 900&#x2013;1204. Stephenson has researched and taught in the UK, Germany, and the USA.Stephenson, a historian at the University of Durham, successfully combines historical documents, examples of Roman art, sculpture, and coinage with the lessons of geopolitics to produce a complex biography of the Emperor Constantine. Rather than the divinely guided hero of legend who singlehandedly brought pagan Rome to Christian orthodoxy, Constantine is depicted as very much a product of his political environment. Recognizing the growing influence of the Christian Church, he adapted the generally pacifist faith to the Roman theology of victory and created a newly militant Christianity that would sustain his rule. Constantine wisely sought to impose religious toleration on the diverse Roman Empire while discouraging trivial disputes among the Christian faithful. Stephenson examines the variety of religious beliefs in the early fourth century with emphasis on Mithraism, a pagan mystery cult practiced by pre-Constantine soldiers, and on the bitter divisions within victorious Christianity that ultimately led to the Council of Nicaea. Constantine is revealed as a master politician who, while delaying his own baptism for reasons not fully explained in the text, became the ruler of both church and state. 24 pages of illus.; 8 maps. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Also like the Bible, the Quran, and the Bhagavad Gita, the Talmud is a powerful source of allusion in large part even though so few people have really read it. People don't read the Talmud because they think it's inaccessible--the sprawling collection of rabbinic writings is added to in each generation, and its significance is nothing less than the summary of Judaism. The best guide to the Talmud's labyrinthine form is Abraham Cohen's <i>Everyman's Talmud: The Major Teachings of the Rabbinic Sages</i>--a monumental work of scholarly summary that describes all the basic doctrines of Judaism. <i>Everyman's Talmud</i> includes concise chapters on everything from sin to superstitions to a Jew's duty to animals. You probably won't be able to read it straight through--doctrine, even elegantly distilled, is hard to take in big doses--but you'll be led back to it again and again, by questions that arise in daily life, at dinner parties, and from the pages of the daily newspaper. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Abraham Cohen (1887-1957) was the editor of the Soncino Books of the Bible and participated in the Soncino translation of the Talmud and Midrash.</p><h2>Intrigue in Covent Garden: The Thirteenth Thomas Chaloner Adventure (Adventures of Thomas Chaloner)</h2><p><p>By January 1666, the plague has almost disappeared from London, leaving its surviving population diminished and in poverty.

BAITED</b> <p> </p><blockquote> "While our civilian population worried about Armageddon, submarine crews at sea did all they could to stave it off, living on the edge constantly. On the strategic level of this epic struggle, no one did more than our submarine force, the submarines and their crews, to win the Cold War." <p> -- Rear Admiral Robert R. Fountain USN (Ret.) </p></blockquote> <p> </p> <b>I</b> <p> located in the atlantic ocean off the african coast, the Canary Islands are a familiar sight to seamen plying the ancient maritime trade lanes between Europe, Asia, and North America, routes that are likewise known for their historical importance to naval strategists. In early April 1968, the curiosity of U.S. intelligence experts was aroused when their reconnaissance flights and Keyhole photographic satellites spotted a group of three Russian surface vessels and a NATO-designation Echo II nuclear-powered guided missile submarine conducting mysterious actions in the open sea, about four hundred miles southwest of the volcanic island chain. A month later, the flotilla continued to linger in the area, baffling analysts with its movements. </p><p> At the time, Russian exercises were mostly restricted to sheltered inlets, bays, and rivers closer to their homeports and guarded to the best possible extent from the scrutiny of America and its NATO allies. But now the Soviets were floating weather balloons, or what appeared to be weather balloons, in full view of American observers. </p><p> The nuclear sub only made things more interesting. With its complement of eight Shaddock antiship missiles, an Echo II -- designed for the sole purpose of attacking American aircraft carrier battle groups -- would be a valued target of surveillance to the Anti-Submarine Warfare Force, Atlantic Fleet (ASWFORLANT), whose air and naval units were already monitoring Russian submarine activities in the wide swath of ocean between the Canaries and the Azores. Code-named Bravo 20, this operation had been underway for a while, often with the participation of SUBLANT's nuclear fleet boats. </p><p> Rear Admiral Philip A. Beshany, deputy chief of submarine warfare operations, would later say that the focus of new concern was the possibility of the Soviets developing a way to support their warships and submarines without requiring access to foreign bases for supplies. Most authorities on Soviet marine operations, however, came to dismiss his explanation. Refueling and resupply at sea had been taking place since before World War II. In wartime, a lumbering support ship wouldn't last more than a couple of days before it was discovered and sunk. On its face, it made little or no sense that the ships traveled 1,500 miles out of the Mediterranean to perform experiments that could have been done in friendlier waters. And what of those balloons? </p><p> Intelligence experts in Washington were convinced there had to be some other reason for the conspicuous presence of the ships -- and some means of determining what it was. The Special Naval Collection Program (SNCP) oversaw and directed a range of submarine espionage operations under the code name Holystone, and checking out the oddball Soviet flotilla fell under its purview. </p><p> In those days, America always kept five to seven submarines in the region of the Mediterranean. Their six-month tours usually overlapped, with one sub transiting the Great Circle Route between the Mediterranean and the continental United States every four weeks. It would be easy enough to divert to the Canaries a submarine on its way home. And the Soviets were aware of this. </p><p> The Soviets also held some other critical pieces of information, namely the means and patterns of U.S. aerial reconnaissance in the region. Their radar could detect U.S. spy planes long before they came into visual range. They knew the exact orbital schedule of the KH-8 photo intelligence birds. And, as was often the case in those days of tag-you're-it Cold War intrigue, their American intelligence counterparts knew they knew. </p><p> While Soviet vessels normally conducted their experiments at night when observation was most difficult, the maneuvers near the Canaries were peculiar exceptions. The flotilla would launch its balloons in broad daylight and wait until the last minute to bring its movements to a halt, breaking off right before U.S. naval aircraft or satellites approached -- almost as if wanting to be noticed. This behavior added to the questions surrounding the flotilla's presence. Were the ships playing a game? Taunting their observers with false attempts to avoid detection? If so, why? What other activities might the Russians be concealing with their shadow dance? </p><p> A former <i>Scorpion</i> sailor who'd been aboard the boat for several Cold War Holystone missions into Soviet territorial waters would compare the tantalizing ship movements to a matador's waving of his red cape in the bull ring: Hey look, here I am, come and get me! </p><p> Indeed, Washington's intelligence experts were far more intrigued by the flotilla's peculiar actions than its composition. Of the four vessels only the sub was designed for battle. Two of the others were hydrographic survey ships, the third a rescue and support tug. All three surface craft had acoustical signatures -- distinct sonar voiceprints -- that had been recorded by past spy missions and were easily identifiable to ASWFORLANT's sonobuoys, making them of little or no intrinsic military interest. Moreover, if unusual electronic activity -- radio transmissions from the Soviet vessels, for instance -- had been a major concern to analysts, it would have been standard procedure to dispatch an EC-121 or P-3 Orion reconnaissance plane that could observe the ships from the air. </p><p> But a submarine held a significant advantage over the floating buoys and spy planes: it could steal up on the Russian ships for a close-up look at whatever was going on with them. Checking out the Echo II would essentially amount to an added bonus. </p><p> Although some Navy officials later insisted that getting a sub out to the area was routine, their assertion was contradicted by one of the principals involved in the intelligence-gathering process, a ranking officer who'd kept an eye on the Russian vessels for weeks. </p><p> "We recognized the high desirability of getting over there and taking a look at them," Captain Walter N. "Buck" Dietzen recalled. When the flotilla was spotted, Dietzen was the Pentagon assistant to Rear Admiral Philip Beshany, deputy chief of naval operations for submarine warfare. "I was salivating in the [Pentagon's] corridors to find out what they were doing," he would add. </p><p> The desire of which Dietzen spoke would soon translate into a direct, highly classified order that came down to the USS <i>Scorpion</i> from the Navy's top-most echelons. Even today, one can see why she was picked for the mission. With her speed and quiet stealth, the Skipjack-class submarine was ideally suited for snooping on the Soviet vessels. She had done that sort of thing often enough, and would be in their general neighborhood anyway. </p><p> Vice Admiral Arnold F. Schade, commander of the Atlantic Fleet's submarine force, would have the communiqu� sent out to <i>Scorpion</i> from the message room at operational headquarters in Norfolk. </p><p> It isn't known whether John Walker Jr. was on duty at the time. It's also moot. Walker had easy access to the vault where the coded dispatch was filed, and would have been aware of it. </p><p> He was always on the furtive lookout for exactly that sort of thing. </p><p> </p> <b>II</b> <p> Whether aboard a submarine or surface vessel, sailors didn't have many ways to spend their downtime while traversing the high seas. Among <i>Scorpion's</i> crewmen "best beard" contests were a standby, since shaving was not a requirement during patrols. The winners would receive cash prizes, with judging of the contest held toward the end of the deployment. There would be many categories -- bushiest beard, fullest beard, and most artistic beard. </p><p> Gregg Pennington, a former <i>Scorpion</i> nuke, remembered some of his shipmates getting creative in their efforts to relieve the monotony. On one patrol, they decided to fashion rings out of English half-crown coins they'd picked up on liberty in Holy Loch, Scotland. This took patience, resourcefulness, and no small measure of clandestine assistance from various quarters throughout the sub. Spoons vanished from the galley and magically reappeared in crewmen's pockets. Using them as makeshift jeweler's hammers, the men would tap the inside curves of the spoons on the edges of the coins until they flattened out to a desired width. Next, machinist's mates were enlisted to drill out the centers of the coins. As a finishing touch, the amateur ringsmiths would impart a sparkling smoothness to their handiwork with small metal files. </p><p> Generally, though, the men would find more mundane diversions. When a sailor completed his watch and needed to unwind before turning in, he would grab a bite to eat from the galley and then kill a couple of hours playing card games, checkers, or Acey Deucy with some of the other off-duty crewmen -- either that or catch a movie in the crew's mess. As a rule the interior communications electricians would run the movies. The IC men were responsible for a wide range of equipment, including the ship's projector. </p><p> Before going off on deployment, a vessel always loaded up on film reels from a movie exchange on base. Since a nuclear-powered sub would be at sea for two or three months at a time, it brought along between sixty and seventy movies, ensuring that a new film could be screened every night -- at least during those first couple of months. If you got a really good film, it might be shown two or three times a day. As long as the sub wasn't in dangerous waters, and the IC man got permission from Control to burn a flick, it didn't matter how often the movies were shown. </p><p> The film exchange process was uncomplicated when ships were in their homeports. After a vessel returned from patrol, a member of its c...</p></p><h2>A Study in Sable (Elemental Masters)</h2><p><b>The eleventh novel in Mercedes Lackey's magical Elemental Masters series reimagines Sherlock Holmes in a richly-detailed alternate 20th century England</b><br><br>Psychic Nan Killian and Medium Sarah Lyon-White&#x2014;along with their clever birds, the raven Neville and the parrot Grey&#x2014;have been agents of Lord Alderscroft, the Elemental Fire Master known as the Wizard of London, since leaving school. <br><br>Now, Lord Alderscroft assigns them another commission: to work with the famous man living at 221 Baker Street&#x2014;but not the one in flat B.

And he didn&#x2019;t rise to the heady heights of the front ranks of the Irregulars and the good graces of the guv&#x2019;nor without having nerves of steel wire and a mind like a rattrap, ready to snap on any bit of information that came his way. Wiggins himself trusted Tommy as his right-hand man, and the guv&#x2019;nor trusted no Irregular more than Wiggins.<br><br>With that sort of regard resting on his shoulders, a feller had to be smart, quick, and steady as Windsor Castle. A feller couldn&#x2019;t let himself get the wind up about anything, no matter how spooky it was. There was more than enough peril in the alleys and shadows without letting your imagination make more.<br><br>But Tommy Grimeshad to admit to himself that the toff he was following through fog-wreathed streets was giving him a lot of goose bumps. That was strange, because there wasn&#x2019;t much that put the hair up on Tommy&#x2019;s head, and he&#x2019;d poked into more nasty places than most. And it was strange, because so far, the gent had only acted a bit peculiar, and Tommy followed fellers who had acted quite mad before without getting collywobbles about it. So, he was getting the cauld grue, and it was for no obvious reason that <i>he</i> could see.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t how the blighter looked; he was well dressed, in a long, double-breasted dark coat and matching trousers; without an overcoat, which wasn&#x2019;t unusual tonight, but without a hat, which was. His graying black hair was cut longer than most, wavy, and a bit disheveled, but in a manner a lady would likely say was &#x201c;artistic.&#x201d; As gents went, he&#x2019;d probably be reckoned handsome, by ladies anyway. Except for his hair, everything about him was fastidiously tidy. No one was giving him a second glance as he passed by. But then, this was a nice neighborhood; good thing it was dark and no one could see the tattered state of Tommy&#x2019;s clothes. Not that people like this paid any attention to a lad like him anyway, so long as he didn&#x2019;t get within an arm&#x2019;s length of &#x2019;em, on account of if he got close, they&#x2019;d likely think he was about to stick his hand in their pockets. This toff, though, he fit right in and only occasioned a slight smile from a lady, or a nod from a gent as they passed each other on the street. Simple politeness among the gentry.<br><br>Not that there were many of the gentry out at this time of night. Folks what lived around here were all asleep, trusting to their locks, their servants, and the police to keep &#x2019;em safe. Mostly they were asleep in their own beds, though sometimes they were in beds where they didn&#x2019;t rightly belong, but that was none of Tommy&#x2019;s business, &#x2019;cept when the guv&#x2019;nor made it his business.<br><br>But this toff had caught Tommy&#x2019;s attention on account of Tommy could tell he wasn&#x2019;t just strolling, but paying right close attention to whether or not there was anyone about. Once the street was clear, he stopped dead still, inclined his head as if he was listening to someone&#x2014;nodded, and then whispered a word or two back&#x2014;and then continued on his way with the determined step of someone who knew exactly where he was going. Tommy&#x2019;d thought maybe the old gent was a bit barmy, until he did it a couple more times, and each time he did, it was pretty obvious he was getting directions. But directions from what?<br><br>The second time he&#x2019;d listened to something that weren&#x2019;t there, Tommy knew his instincts hadn&#x2019;t been playing tricks on him, and there was something even the guv&#x2019;nor might not be able to explain going on. He thought about breaking off at that point and letting the gent go on his way, but you never knew what scrap of odd knowledge might be worth something to the boss. <i>Maybe not the boss, though. Maybe the Major. Talkin&#x2019; to things as ain&#x2019;t there&#x2019;s more his line.</i> That was all right. The Major paid just as well as the boss did.<br><br>And, as they got closer and closer to the Thames, and the respectable types gave way to loungers and drunks and whores, no one but Tommy saw him make tiny little gestures and whisper a few more words, and then go on as completely unmolested as if he was invisible. <i>That</i> made Tommy go cold all over and think again about continuing to follow the man. Surely he had enough, even for the Major.<br><br>But it didn&#x2019;t seem that the man knew he was being followed, so Tommy gathered his tattered courage about him and put everything the boss had taught him about tailing agent into immediate use. Because the Major would pay more, a lot more, if he knew what the man had been getting directions <i>to</i>.<br><br>But when it became very clear that the gent was heading for the waterfront and the docks themselves, Tommy grew very unhappy indeed, and for a whole different set of reasons than just unchancy behavior. This wasn&#x2019;t his lay; another set of gangs ruled the waterfront, and they didn&#x2019;t much like the Baker Street boys cutting in. Sure, some of them answered to the boss, but plenty more didn&#x2019;t, and no telling who was in which until there was a knife looking for your liver and you found your luck had run out.<br><br>But whatever was making the fancy toff invisible to the gangs seemed to be working for Tommy, too. No one harassed them; the waterfront was uncannily quiet. The man&#x2019;s path took him away from the taverns and alehouses, down silent, darkened byways Tommy would have got lost in on his own, avoiding anything other than the occasional night watchman. On they went, first to and then under the docks. And oh, even to Tommy&#x2019;s nose, inured as he was to smells, this place <i>stank</i>. Sewage warred with dead fish, which in turn warred with the smell of rotting things best not guessed at. The tide was going out; it was the hour of the mudlarks, as the Thames left its odorous leavings on the mud-banks, and anything could be found, from a silver coin from the time of the eighth Henry to a deader, though most of what washed up was rags and bits of wood and rotten stuff. Needless to say, the deaders outnumbered the silver coins by quite a lot. There was the suicides, of course; there was always one or two of those a night. But there was also them as hadn&#x2019;t gone into the water of their own free will. And accidents, though it was hard to tell them from the ones that was pushed.<br><br>Tommy didn&#x2019;t dare follow the gent out into the mud (though somehow he wasn&#x2019;t sinking ankle-deep in the stuff like any proper human would), but he skulked in the shadows on the rocks under the docks and watched with all his eyes as the gent went straight to&#x2014;something&#x2014;lying asprawl in shallow water in the silvery moonlight.<br><br>The gent turned the thing over with a curious air of reverence, and a particularly strong beam of moonlight revealed a white, white face and long golden hair, and a fan of pale dress splayed out on the mud like so much seaweed.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Perd�name, querida</i>,&#x201d; said the gent, and the blade of a very sharp knife flashed for a moment in the moonlight.<br><br>Tommy felt horror grip him. It was one thing to cut up a man who meant to cut you up. It was quite another to cut up the dead. The dead should be left alone.<br><br>Then clouds covered the moon, and as Tommy found himself caught in a paralysis of terror, the man . . . did something to the corpse. Tommy heard a roaring like the sea in his ears, and everything went dark for a moment, and when he came to himself again, clutching at the wet, barnacle-covered support he&#x2019;d hidden behind, the gent . . . was gone.<br><br>Quite gone, as if he had vanished right into thin air, like a conjurer. Except that Tommy knew quite a lot of conjurer&#x2019;s tricks, thanks to the boss, and no man that <i>he</i> knew of had ever been able to vanish from off a mudflat on the banks of the Thames without leaving a trace of his passing.<br><br>So, when Tommy managed to gird up his courage and make his way out to where the body lay, he found that, to his relief, the cove had made a decent set of footprints going back besides the set he&#x2019;d made going out. So at least he hadn&#x2019;t been following some mad spirit or . . . demon. . . .<br><br>Even if those prints <i>were</i> far shallower than they had any right to be, as if the man had weighed no more than a child.<br><br>But then he discovered what the man had been after, and the discovery sent him floundering back to the banks, to the wharves, and racing for his life for the familiar and understandable evils of drunken savages and opium fiends and twelve-year-old prostitutes and murderous thieves.<br><br>For what manner of decent, upright man could possibly have wanted the arm bone of a poor drowned girl and her long, muddy, golden hair?<br><br>And most of all, in the name of all things sane . . . <i>why</i>?<br><b>1</b><br><br>It was just after luncheon, in a neighborhood that mostly catered to working-class people. The buildings were all three and four stories tall here, several had little shops on the ground floors, or the offices of those professional men who could not afford more prestigious neighborhoods. A very few were still the dwellings of single families who could afford several servants. For the most part, however, the place was chock-ablock with reasonably priced flats&#x2014;reasonably priced if one was doing well as a shopkeeper or a rising clerk, and if one was not, well, one could always find someone to share the flat with.<br><br>This was certainly the case with the gentleman who was about to interview the two young ladies who were outside a greengrocer&#x2019;s establishment. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said Nan Killian, gazing across the busy street at the very unprepossessing front of a purely residential building. Tall and narrow, like most buildings in this part of London, it might have been the home of one of those single families, with a kitchen on the ground floor and servants&#x2019; quarters in the attic, but it was, in fact, carved up into flats presided over by a landlady who resided on the ground floor and provided meals and charlady services to her lodgers. There were three flats; their goal was the middlemost one.<br><br>&#x201c;Well indeed, and well enough,&#x201d; Sarah Lyon-White replied, flashing an impish smile at her tall friend. &#x201c;Shall we go beard the dragon in his den? It would be a shame to have come all this way to show the white feather and run away, besides being a great disappointment to Lord A and Master M.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Mister</i> M can go stuff&#x2014;&#x201d; Nan began.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Nan!</i>&#x201d; said Sarah, in pretense of shock.<br><br>&#x201c;&#x2014;his hat up a drainpipe for all I care,&#x201d; Nan continued smoothly. &#x201c;But I would never like Lord Alderscroft to think we were too cowardly to deal with a mere mortal man. Even if, up until a few days ago, we thought he was merely a literary construction. All right then. On we go. After all, it&#x2019;s only an interview.&#x201d;<br><br>Suiting her actions to her words, Nan checked the oncoming traffic for runaway hansoms and inconsiderate carters and strode across the London street, with her much shorter friend Sarah half-skipping along beside her.<br><br>Not troubling to wait for the landlady to answer a knock, she opened the door to the narrow, tidy, but sparsely furnished entryway, and spotted the staircase leading to the first floor and flat &#x201c;B.&#x201d; Still leading Sarah by a few paces, she ran up the stairs and knocked briskly on the door. It was opened almost immediately.<br><br>The gentleman in the dark gray suit who opened it raised one sardonic, heavy eyebrow. &#x201c;Very prompt, I see. You would be&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Miss Killian. And this is Miss Lyon-White,&#x201d; said Nan, taking the open door as an invitation to come in, which she did. Sarah was right on her heels.<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed. Would you take a&#x2014;&#x201d; the man began, but Nan strode across an untidy room packed with all manner of curious objects and smelling strongly of tobacco and faintly of gunpowder and chemicals, and threw open the window that overlooked the street.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope you are not some manner of fresh air fiend, Miss Killian,&#x201d; the gentleman said, without showing a flicker of surprise that Nan had made so free with his window. &#x201c;I am sorry to say that the air on this street is not the most salubrious.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not at all, sir,&#x201d; Nan replied, half-turning from the window. &#x201c;But as you are well aware, Sarah and I are only half of the quartet you are to interview.&#x201d; A swiftly moving shadow flashed between the light and the window, and there was a sound of flapping wings as an African grey parrot suddenly landed on the sill. &#x201c;Ah, here is the third of the party,&#x201d; Nan said calmly, offering a hand to the parrot, who stepped up onto it, then used it as a launching point to take a shorter flight across the room to come to rest on the back of the chair Sarah had taken at the invitation of their host.<br><br>A much larger shadow interposed in the next moment, and an enormous raven replaced the parrot on the sill.<br><br>&#x201c;And here is the last of us,&#x201d; said Nan with satisfaction. The raven leapt ponderously to her shoulder with a flap of his wings and she closed the window again. With the raven balanced precisely on her shoulder, she took her place in the armchair next to Sarah&#x2019;s, closer to the fire. The raven transferred himself to the back of her chair. The gentleman took his own seat on the settle opposite them, and silence descended as they took stock of one another.<br><br>Nan knew what he would see as he looked at them; she wondered if it surprised him, amused him, or merely entered into his calculations. Two young women in their early twenties, regarding him with direct and unwinking gazes, as direct as if they had been young <i>men</i>, and not women. The shorter, Sarah, had the sort of face that could have graced a Professional Beauty, if she had cared to travel that route, surmounted by a slightly untidy coif of masses of blond hair piled up in an approximation of a pompadour hairdo. She wore no hat, largely because she had a tendency to lose them. As for Nan, she had a face that could charitablybe called &#x201c;strong&#x201d; and which she privately thought of as &#x201c;horsey,&#x201d; and her own hair was confined in a very tidy French Roll under a small, neat, unadorned round felt hat. They were both wearing gowns of dull colors&#x2014;grays and blues for Sarah and browns for Nan&#x2014;which might be described as &#x201c;dowdy&#x201d; (although Sarah could never look dowdy in anything). However, the knowing eye would recognize their gowns as Ladies&#x2019; Rational Dress, a mode of non-fashion that allowed the wearer almost as much freedom of movement as if she were in a bloomer suit. Nan rather thought their interviewer had already recognized that.</p></p><h2>Lost at Sea: The Jon Ronson Mysteries</h2><p><i>The New York Times</i>&#x2013;bestselling author of <i>The Psychopath Test</i>, Jon Ronson writes about the dark, uncanny sides of humanity with clarity and humor. <i>Lost at Sea </i>reveals how deep our collective craziness lies, even in the most mundane circumstances.<br><br>Ronson investigates the strange things we&#x2019;re willing to believe in, from lifelike robots programmed with our loved ones&#x2019; personalities to indigo children to hypersuccessful spiritual healers to the Insane Clown Posse&#x2019;s juggalo fans.

Amateur nuclear physicists, assisted-suicide practitioners, the town of North Pole, Alaska&#x2019;s Christmas-induced high school mass-murder plot: Ronson explores all these tales with a sense of higher purpose and universality, and suddenly, mid-read, they are stories not about the fringe of society or about people far removed from our own experience, but about all of us.<br><br>Incisive and hilarious, poignant and maddening, revealing and disturbing&#x2014;Ronson writes about our modern world, the foibles of contemporary culture, and the chaos that lies at the edge of our daily lives.</p><p>Jon Ronson&#x2019;s books include the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>The Psychopath Test</i>, and <i>Them: Adventures with Extremists </i>and <i>The Men Who Stare at Goats</i>&#x2014;both international bestsellers. <i>The Men Who Stare at Goats </i>was adapted as a major motion picture, released in 2009 and starring George Clooney. Ronson lives in London and New York City.Who Killed Richard Cullen? <br><br>(This story was published in the Guardian on July 16, 2005, two years before the global financial crash that began with the subprime mortgage crisis of July 2007.) <br><br>It is a wet February day in a very smoky room in a terraced cottage in Trowbridge, Wiltshire. A portable TV in an alcove plays the news. Everything in here is quite old. No spending spree has taken place in this house. There are wedding and baby and school photographs scattered around. Six children, now all grown up, were raised here. There&#x2019;s a framed child&#x2019;s painting in the toilet, a picture of Wendy Cullen. It reads &#x201c;Supergran.&#x201d; When I phoned Wendy a week ago she said I was welcome to visit, &#x201c;Just as long as you don&#x2019;t mind cigarette smoke. I&#x2019;m smoking myself to death here.&#x201d; <br><br>The &#x201c;Congratulations! You have been pre-approved for a loan&#x201d;&#x2013; type junk mail is still pouring through their letterbox. Wendy has just thrown another batch in the bin. <br><br>&#x201c;You know what the post is like,&#x201d; she says. <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t get all that much credit-card junk mail,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;I get some, I suppose, but not nearly as much as you do.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; says Wendy. &#x201c;I assumed everyone was constantly bombarded.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;Not me,&#x201d; I say. <br><br>We both shrug as if to say, &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a mystery.&#x201d; <br><br>IT WAS A month ago today that Wendy&#x2019;s husband, Richard, committed suicide. It was the end of what had been an ordinary twenty-five-year marriage. They met when Wendy owned a B and B on the other side of Trowbridge. He turned up one day and rented a room. Richard had trained to be an electrical engineer but he ended up as a mechanic. <br><br>&#x201c;He loved repairing people&#x2019;s cars,&#x201d; Wendy says. Then she narrows her eyes at my line of questioning and makes me promise that I am not here to write &#x201c;a slushy horrible mawky love story.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m really not,&#x201d; I say. So Wendy continues. Everything was normal until six years ago, when she needed an operation. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t face the Royal United Hospital in Bath,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;so I went private. I took out a four-thousand-pound loan.&#x201d; <br><br>She says she remembers a time when it was hard for people like them to get loans, but this was easy. Companies were practically throwing money at them. <br><br>&#x201c;Richard handled all the finances. He said, &#x2018;I can get you one with nought percent interest and after six months we&#x2019;ll switch you to another one.&#x2019; &#x201d; <br><br>But then, a few months after the first operation, Wendy was diagnosed with breast cancer and Richard had to take six weeks off to drive her to radiotherapy. The bills needed paying and so, once again, he did that peculiarly modern British thing. He began signing up for credit cards, behaving like a company, thinking he could beat the lenders at their own game by cleverly rolling the debts over from account to account. <br><br>There are currently eight million more credit cards in circulation in Britain than there are people: sixty-seven million credit cards, fifty-nine million people. <br><br>He signed up with Mint: &#x201c;Apply for your Mint Card. You&#x2019;d need a seriously good reason not to. What&#x2019;s stopping you?&#x201d; <br><br>And Frizzell: &#x201c;A name you can trust.&#x201d; <br><br>And Barclaycard: &#x201c;Wake up to a fresh start.&#x201d; <br><br>And Morgan Stanley: &#x201c;Choose from our Flags of Great Britain range of card designs.&#x201d; <br><br>And American Express: &#x201c;Go on, treat yourself.&#x201d; <br><br>And so on. <br><br>Right now nobody knows how Richard Cullen&#x2019;s shrewd acumen fell apart. <br><br>&#x201c;He wasn&#x2019;t a man that talked a great deal,&#x201d; says Wendy, &#x201c;and he never, ever discussed finances with me.&#x201d; But somehow it all spiraled out of control. <br><br>Wendy first got the inkling that something was wrong just before Christmas 2004, when the debt-collection departments of various credit-card companies began phoning. He called them back out of his wife&#x2019;s hearing. <br><br>&#x201c;You know how men will walk around with their mobiles,&#x201d; says Wendy. &#x201c;He used to go out into the garden.&#x201d; <br><br>She looks over to the garden behind the conservatory extension and says, &#x201c;He was a very proud man. He must have been going through hell. They were very, very persistent. I don&#x2019;t think he was even phoning them back in the end.&#x201d; <br><br>Finally, he admitted it to his wife. He said he didn&#x2019;t seek out all of the twenty-two credit cards he had somehow ended up acquiring between 1998 and 2004. On many occasions they just arrived through the letterbox in the form of &#x201c;Congratulations! You have been pre-approved . . .&#x201d; junk. He said he thought he owed about �30,000. There had been no spending spree, he said, no secret vices. He had just tied himself up in knots, using each card to pay off the interest and the charges on the others. The fog of late-payment fees and so on had somehow crept up and engulfed him. He got a pair of scissors from the kitchen and cut up ten credit cards in front of her. <br><br>On January 10, 2005, Richard visited his ex-wife, Jennifer, who later told the police that he seemed &#x201c;very quiet, like he&#x2019;d retreated into himself, like his mind was gone.&#x201d; <br><br>She asked him how his weekend was. He replied, &#x201c;Not very good.&#x201d; <br><br>Then he went missing for two days. <br><br>&#x201c;Nobody knows where he went,&#x201d; says Wendy. <br><br>On the morning of January 12, Wendy&#x2019;s son Christopher looked in the garage. It was padlocked, so he broke in with a screwdriver. There was an old Vauxhall Nova covered with a sheet. <br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why,&#x201d; Christopher later told the police, &#x201c;but I decided to look under the sheet.&#x201d; <br><br>Richard Cullen had gassed himself in his car. He left his wife a note: &#x201c;I just can&#x2019;t take this any more and you&#x2019;ll be better off without me.&#x201d;<br>WHO KILLED RICHARD CULLEN? <br>For instance: Why did so many credit-card companies choose to swamp the Cullens with junk when they don&#x2019;t swamp me? <br><br>How did they even get their address? How can I even begin to find something complicated like that out? <br><br>And then I have a brainwave. I&#x2019;ll devise an experiment. I&#x2019;ll create a number of personas. Their surnames will all be Ronson, and they&#x2019;ll all live at my address, but they&#x2019;ll have different first names. Each Ronson will be poles apart, personality wise. Each will have a unique set of hopes, desires, predilections, vices, and spending habits, reflected in the various mailing lists they&#x2019;ll sign up to&#x2014;from Porsche down to hard-core pornography. The one thing that&#x2019;ll unite them is that they won&#x2019;t be at all interested in credit cards. They will not seek loans nor any financial services as they wander around, filling out lifestyle surveys and entering competitions and purchasing things by mail order. Whenever they&#x2019;re invited to tick a box forbidding whichever company from passing their details to other companies, they&#x2019;ll neglect to tick the box. <br><br>Which, if any, of my personas will end up getting sent credit-card junk mail? Which personality type will be most attractive to the credit-card companies? <br><br>I name my personas John, Paul, George, Ringo, Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick, Titch, Willy, Biff, Happy and Bernard. And I begin.</p><h2>Mercy, Mercy Me: The Art, Loves and Demons of Marvin Gaye</h2><p>Twenty years after his murder at the hands of his own father, Marvin Gaye continues to define the hopes and shattered dreams of the Motown generation. A performer whose career spanned the history of rhythm and blues, from doo-wop to the sultriest of soul music, Gaye's artistry magnified the contradictions that defined America's coming of age in the tumultuous 1970s. In his most searching and ambitious work to date, acclaimed critic Michael Eric Dyson illuminates both Marvin Gaye's stellar achievements and stunning personal decline--and offers an unparalleled assessment of the cultural and political legacy of R&amp;B on American culture.Through interviews with those close to Gaye--from his musical beginnings in a black church in Washington, D.C., to his days as a "ladies' man" in Motown's stable of young singers, from the artistic heights of the landmark album What's Going On? to his struggles with addiction and domestic violence--Dyson draws an indelible portrait of the tensio</p><p><b>Michael Eric Dyson</b>, named by <i>Ebony</i> as one of the hundred most influential black Americans, is the author of sixteen books, including <i>Holler if You Hear Me</i> , <i>Is Bill Cosby Right?</i> and <i>I May Not Get There With You: The True Martin Luther King Jr.</i> He is currently University Professor of Sociology at Georgetown University. He lives in Washington, D.C.Long before his premature death, Marvin Gaye had attained the kind of iconic cultural status that shrouds an individual with so many layers of meaning that it may be hard for him to tell where his person ends and his persona begins. Two decades later, Gaye's influence remains so pervasive that it has almost become a clich� for young R&amp;B singers such as R. Kelly, Maxwell and D'Angelo to cite him as a source of inspiration. At the same time, we are no closer to understanding Gaye, a turbulent soul who helped define soul music and became a celebrated voice of his generation. Illuminating the life of the brilliant and troubled musician is the task that Michael Eric Dyson sets for himself in Mercy, Mercy Me.<p>On one level, we might see Gaye as the latest entry in what we could call the Dyson Icon Project. Dyson, a professor of humanities at the University of Pennsylvania, has an abiding interest in black men who live complex, often troubled lives and die violent deaths. The subjects of three of his previous books -- Malcolm X, Tupac Shakur and Martin Luther King Jr. -- each became a walking metaphor for the era in which he lived, and all three were gunned down in public. These works have provided both penetrating insights, such as Dyson's thorough assessment of King's virtues and limitations as a theologian, and glib observations, such as his unconvincing analysis of the alleged similarities in King's and Shakur's personalities. In Gaye, Dyson has found a figure as enigmatic, complex and compelling as any of his previous subjects -- a man whose troubled life was also ended by a hail of bullets, albeit from a gun that was purchased by him and fired by his father.</p><p>Born in 1939 into an extremely religious family in Washington, D.C., Marvin early on became a target of the violent temper of his father, a Pentecostal minister. His adolescence was marked by his father's beatings, the strict religious demands of the household and the ridicule of other children based on from his father's reputation as a cross-dresser. (Dyson contends that this was likely a factor in Marvin's decision to add an extra letter to his surname, hoping to avoid the connotations of carrying the last name "Gay.") The author also cites a third-party source's claim that the physical abuse Gaye suffered from his father was compounded by sexual abuse from an uncle. Regardless, it is clear that the Gay household was far from idyllic. The young Marvin found his outlet in secular music, which was both an escape from the brutality of his family life and a defiance of his father's injunctions against nonreligious pursuits.</p><p>Music, as Dyson points out, was Gaye's balm -- not his salvation. He failed in early attempts to forge a career as a black Sinatra-style crooner and moved only hesitantly toward soul music. He devoted a great deal of artistic -- and personal -- energy to reconciling his spiritual and sexual selves, a conflict that heightened his appeal as an artist. "Spiritual tensions," Dyson informs us, "roiled his sexual identity. He won from his battles, at least on record, a level of mature self-awareness." Outside the recording studio, however, was another matter. Gaye, Dyson informs us, fathered a child with 15-year-old Denise Gordy (niece of his then-wife Anna Gordy, who adopted the baby) in an arrangement that recalls the biblical tale of Sarah and Abraham: "Marvin did not tell [his biographer] that he was the baby's biological father. It was understandable: Marvin had made love to a minor, apparently with the consent of all involved. Still Denise was under the age of legal consent and Marvin might have gone to jail for statutory rape." </p><p>Many of these revelations have been touched upon in previous works, particularly David Ritz's excellent biography. But Dyson is careful to draw the distinction that this book is not a biography of Gaye but rather a work of what he calls biocriticism. (It is organized thematically, not chronologically.) Dyson's goal is not so much to serve old wine in a new bottle as it is to create a new beverage altogether. Ultimately, this approach is both a virtue and a liability.</p><p>Mercy, Mercy Me is at its best when Dyson untangles the complex mythology surrounding Gaye and offers insightful conjectures about the motivations of a genius. Writing of the complicated -- and possibly romantic -- relationship between Gaye and his most noted collaborator Tammi Terrell, he notes that their pairing took place in an "eerie, ironic fashion in which two people who brought such beauty into the world through their art couldn't see it in themselves." His analysis of "What's Going On," the 1971 classic LP, is both incisive and original. He argues convincingly that the title track was Gaye's attempt to break with the formulaic redundancy of the "Motown Sound." (Label founder Berry Gordy initially referred to it as "the worst single he'd ever heard," but after selling 100,000 copies ordered more just like it.) The landmark release, Dyson informs us, was conceived and executed in 10 days.</p><p>On the subject of Gaye's murder, Dyson advances the argument that he baited and kicked his father in order to force Marvin Sr.'s hand, that he was attempting a form of passive-aggressive revenge by hanging his own death on his father's conscience. "Marvin," he writes, "extracted from Father a lethal act of generosity in the vocabulary he understood best: violent destruction." While this is an intriguing thesis, Dyson's heavily Freudian discussion (he uses the term "afroedipalism") at times seems a bit contrived. </p><p>The book runs aground in the critical parts of Dyson's "biocriticism." He devotes a good deal of space to arguing with other writers and Gaye critics -- a decision that turns stretches of the book into more of a scholarly review of the literature than an engaging approach to a musical legend. This is important information, certainly, but a more concise approach to those arguments might have kept Gaye in the foreground. Ultimately, though, Dyson leaves us with less of Gaye the enshrined legend and more of Gaye the brilliant and frail human being. Mercy, Mercy Me ably sifts through the layers of meaning and myth surrounding its subject and brings us a degree closer to understanding the enigmatic, compelling and ultimately tragic life of Marvin Gaye.</p><p>Reviewed by William Jelani Cobb <br>Copyright 2004, The Washington Post Co.

Rather than remarry as prosperous London widows usually do, she has taken a lover - David Weir, a foreign merchant who is secretly a Jew and therefore in constant deadly peril so long as he remains in England, where Jews have been banished for over a hundred years.

But her duty and their love become more dangerous a rebel army advances on London - and a murdered body is discovered in the crypt of a London church, mutilated with what a Franciscan friar of the Inquisition claims are Hebrew letters.<br><br>Frevisse must discover not only who is guilty... but whether anyone is innocent at all.<br><br><i>"What Frazer, a meticulous researcher, gets absolutely right in The Sempster's Tale are the attitudes of the charactrs." - Detroit Free Press<br><br>"Medieval English society, culture, and politics come to life in Margaret Frazer's skillful application of vivid imagery, complex characterizations, and an intriguing plot." - BookLoons</i></p><p>Margaret Frazer was a finalist for the Edgar Award for Best Original Paperback for The Servant&#39;s Tale and The Prioress&#39; Tale. She lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota.In Frazer's engrossing 15th historical (after 2005's <i>The Widow's Tale</i>), Dame Frevisse leaves her rural convent for London in the summer of 1450 to procure some vestments from the titular sempster ("seamstress," as Frazer explains in an author's note, didn't come into use until the 1600s). But on arrival in London, she learns that her errand is twofold: in addition to the vestments, she must convey a secret stash of gold from the sempster, a widow named Anne, to Frevisse's cousin, Lady Alice. Alice has more to hide than gold. She's having an affair with Daved, a Jewish merchant. Because Jews have been long expelled from England, Daved pretends to be Christian, while continuing to practice Judaism behind closed doors. Frevisse is drawn ever deeper into intrigue when she accompanies Anne to identify a body that some priests believe shows the marks of a Jewish ritual killing. As usual, Frazer offers careful historical detail and characters you'll want to befriend. <i>(Jan.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

They'll forage for much of their food, and they don't need to be pampered with expensive housing. You don't need a pond for them either, although these friendly birds certainly look beautiful swimming on one.</p><p> Dave Holderread has written Raising the Home Duck Flock for persons who want to raise ducks but don't know how to get started. Here is the answer. He explains how many ducks you should have for various conditions, which breeds may be best for you, where and how to buy them.</p><p> Dave doesn't leave you on your own after you've bought those ducks. His helpful material begins with incubation of eggs, covers how to rear ducklings and manage the adults, explains possible health problems and how to control them, and tells how to butcher the ducks -- with recipes for both the meat and the eggs, and practical suggestions on the use of the feathers and down.</p><p> Dave has raised ducks since his boyhood days, and he's taught hundreds in this country and Puerto Rico through vocational poultry programs.

Demarcation and Demystification examines the ways in which a radical practice of philosophy is possible under the aegis of Marx&#39;s 11th thesis, arguing that philosophy&#39;s radicality is discovered by understanding that it can only ever interpret the world; that social transformation lies beyond the sphere of its operations. &#39;Demarcation and Demystification is a major statement on the gulf between what philosophers actually do, and what they think they do.&#39; Matthew R.

Demonstrating the unusual and exciting way German poetry has evolved, this volume of poems illustrates how, at times, traditions seem to have been lost and then re-created, while many of the poets included here - Weckherlin, Opitz, Klopstock, Goethe, Hoelderin, Rilke, Trakl - seem to start afresh in a way no English poet has done since Chaucer.</p><p></p><h2>Hmong Story Cloths: Preserving Historical &amp; Cultural Treasures</h2><p>Hmong story cloths provide a visual documentation of the historical and cultural legacy of the Hmong people from the country of Laos. The Hmong first began making the story cloths during their time in refugee camps, and featured here are 48 vibrant story cloths that provide a comprehensive look at their lives and culture. The creation of a story cloth begins with the selection of fabric and images outlined onto the fabric. Long satin stitches of multi-colored threads fill in the image, while details are applied with intricate satin stitches and borders pieced together and hand-stitched. Topics include history, traditional life in Laos, Hmong New Year, folk tales, and neighboring people. The quality and diversity of content of the story cloths build upon one another to provide a holistic understanding of the Hmong culture and history. Augmented with personal stories and artifacts, this book is perfect for history buffs and textile artisans alike.</p><p>Linda A.

While investigating the murder of an old friend, he traces clues back to the man&#x2019;s own wealthy family. It is here that we first encounter Henry Rios&#x2019;s struggle to maintain his faith in a legal system caught between justice and corruption, a theme that will continue throughout the series.</p></p><p>Michael Nava is the author of seven Henry Rios novels, five of which (Goldenboy, Howtown, The Hidden Law, The Death of Friends, and Rag and Bone) have been Lambda Literary Award winners. He is an attorney in private practice in San Francisco.This murder mystery about a gay public defender in the San Francisco area is distinguished by good writing and by skillful adaptation of the genre's traditions. Lawyer Henry Rios's loyalty to wealthy wastrel Hugh Paris, with whom he once had a brief affair, strongly recalls the male bonding in Raymond Chandler's classic The Long Goodbye. In both there is a sense of the protagonist as a lost soul trying to justify another person's existence and thereby his own. Through legal documents as much as police work, Rios tracks the murder's clues back to Hugh's family and its conflicts between old money and opportunists, both so greedy and eager to control the family fortune that they will sanction any form of legal trickery, corruption, even murder. Particularly striking is Nava's vision of the legal system as a true instrument of justiceignoring distinctions of position, wealth or sexual preference. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Nail Technician (NAILS)</h2><p>The NAILS Technician module covers the fundamentals of regulatory preparation, guiding the student through an understanding of the biological construction of the nails, hands and feet as well as the sanitation and disinfection procedures critical to avoid the spread of infection in the salon.

But from the moment Jack is called to defend the man, who goes by the name Falcon, something is amiss. For one thing, Falcon comes up with the $10,000 bail&#x2014;in cash. Then the body of a brutally murdered woman is found in the trunk of the abandoned car in which he is living.</p><p>Panicked and on the run, Falcon takes Jack's best friend, Theo, hostage. They end up barricaded in a motel room, and Theo isn't the only one at Falcon's mercy. Jack must work with the cops and their crackerjack negotiator to free Theo and the other captives before Falcon decides he has nothing to lose by killing them all.</p><p>What Jack doesn't know is that Falcon has a much bigger agenda, and that there are people behind the scenes who will stop at nothing to keep their dangerous secrets. Thus unfolds a riveting, lightning-paced story, as only James Grippando can tell it.</p></p><p><p>James Grippando is a <em>New York Times </em>bestselling author of suspense. He was a trial lawyer for twelve years before the publication of his first novel, <em>The Pardon, </em>in 1994. He is now counsel at the law firm of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP and an adjunct professor of law and modern literature at the University of Miami School of Law. His novels are enjoyed world-wide in twenty-eight languages, and his novel <em>Gone Again</em> won the 2017 Harper Lee Prize in Legal Fiction. He lives in South Florida. </p>If Miami criminal defense attorney Jack Swyteck thinks his latest case is weird, he ain't seen nothin' yet. His client, a homeless man who calls himself Falcon, posts $10,000 bail in cash. That has Jack scratching his head, but when a body is found in the trunk of the abandoned car that Falcon calls home, Jack is prepared to go to the mat to defend his client--until, that is, Falcon kidnaps Jack's best friend, and Jack is propelled into an investigation that pushes his abilities to the limit. Although previous Swyteck novels have not been as compelling as most of Grippando's stand-alone thrillers, the series is solid and reliable. This one, which delves into the mystery of the Disappeared, the 30,000-plus Argentineans who (because of their opposition to the military regime) vanished between 1975 and 1983, is deeper than its predecessors. And that's good, because Grippando is at his best when he's telling a story that's more than a mere whodunit. The novel feels darker, more dramatic, than the previous Swyteck adventures, and it's by far the best in the series. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Could these men be part of the "Illuminati" - a group of intellectuals with extremely grand plans for the development of civilization? And if so, what is the grand plan that these men were so determined to bring about, and why should there be such opposition to it? Christopher Knight and Alan Butler reveal that present-day freemasons are the spiritual descendents of an ancient priesthood that was forced to act in secrecy. In the early days of Christianity, their views offended and opposed those of the orthodox Church, and later in feudal Europe, both the State and the established Church considered them heretics and sworn enemies. Yet, they could not be silenced - or defeated - and members of this priesthood have continued to this day to work in subtle and sometimes subversive ways to achieve their aims, often occupying very elevated positions within Western society, and always maintaining complete anonymity to those outside their fellowship.<br>The extraordinary story that unfolds in "Solomon's Power Brokers" reveals that the building of the modern world was no haphazard process. There was a grand plan - and it has succeeded. The "New World Order" is already here.</p><p>Christopher Knight invested seven years conducting research into the origins of Freemasonic rituals. His first book, The Hiram Key (1996), co-authored with Robert Lomas, became an instant bestseller and has since been translated into 37 languages selling over a million copies worldwide. Alan Butler, an engineer, but fascinated by history, also became an expert in astrology and astronomy. He has researched ancient cultures, pagan beliefs and comparative religion and has published four successful books the Knights Templar and the Grail legend.

She introduced detective Jane Rizzoli in&nbsp;<i>The Surgeon</i>&nbsp;(2001) and Dr. Maura Isles in&nbsp;<i>The Apprentice</i>&nbsp;(2002) and has gone on to write numerous other titles in the celebrated Rizzoli &amp; Isles series, including&nbsp;<i>The Mephisto Club, The Keepsake, Ice Cold, The Silent Girl, Last to Die,&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Die Again.&nbsp;</i>Her latest novel is the standalone thriller&nbsp;<i>Playing with Fire.</i>&nbsp;A physician, Tess Gerritsen lives in Maine.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br>He is coming for me.<br><br>&nbsp;I feel it in my bones. I sniff it in the air, as recognizable&nbsp;as the scent of hot sand and savory spices&nbsp;and the sweat of a hundred men toiling in the sun.&nbsp;These are the smells of Egypt&#x2019;s western desert, and&nbsp;they are still vivid to me, although that country is&nbsp;nearly half a globe away from the dark bedroom&nbsp;where I now lie. Fifteen years have passed since I&nbsp;walked that desert, but when I close my eyes, in an&nbsp;instant I am there again, standing at the edge of the&nbsp;tent camp, looking toward the Libyan border and&nbsp;the sunset. The wind moaned like a woman when it&nbsp;swept down the wadi. I still hear the thuds of pickaxes&nbsp;and the scrape of shovels, can picture the&nbsp;army of Egyptian diggers, busy as ants as they&nbsp;swarmed the excavation site, hauling their gufa&nbsp;baskets filled with soil. It seemed to me then, when&nbsp;I stood in that desert fifteen years ago, as if I were&nbsp;an actress in a film about someone else&#x2019;s adventure.&nbsp;Not mine. Certainly it was not an adventure that a&nbsp;quiet girl from Indio, California, ever expected to&nbsp;live.&nbsp;<br><br>The lights of a passing car glimmer through my&nbsp;closed eyelids. When I open my eyes, Egypt vanishes.&nbsp;No longer am I standing in the desert gazing&nbsp;at a sky smeared by sunset the color of bruises. Instead&nbsp;I am once again half a world away, lying in&nbsp;my dark San Diego bedroom.&nbsp;<br><br>I climb out of bed and walk barefoot to the window&nbsp;to look out at the street. It is a tired neighborhood&nbsp;of stucco tract homes built in the 1950s, before&nbsp;the American dream meant mini-mansions and&nbsp;three- car garages. There is honesty in the modest&nbsp;but sturdy houses, built not to impress but to shelter,&nbsp;and I feel safely anonymous here. Just another&nbsp;single mother struggling to raise a recalcitrant&nbsp;teenage daughter.&nbsp;<br><br>Peeking through the curtains at the street, I see a&nbsp;dark- colored sedan slow down half a block away.&nbsp;It pulls over to the curb, and the headlights turn&nbsp;off. I watch, waiting for the driver to step out, but&nbsp;no one does. For a long time the driver sits there.&nbsp;Perhaps he&#x2019;s listening to the radio, or maybe he&#x2019;s&nbsp;had a fight with his wife and is afraid to face her.&nbsp;Perhaps there are lovers in that car with nowhere&nbsp;else to go. I can formulate so many explanations,&nbsp;none of them alarming, yet my skin is prickling with&nbsp;hot dread.&nbsp;<br><br>A moment later the sedan&#x2019;s taillights come back&nbsp;on, and the car pulls away and continues down the&nbsp;street.&nbsp;<br><br>Even after it vanishes around the corner, I am still&nbsp;jittery, clutching the curtains in my damp hand. I&nbsp;return to bed and lie sweating on top of the covers,&nbsp;but I cannot sleep. Although it&#x2019;s a warm July night,&nbsp;I keep my bedroom window latched, and insist that&nbsp;my daughter, Tari, keeps hers latched as well. But&nbsp;Tari does not always listen to me.&nbsp;<br><br>Every day, she listens to me less.<br><br>&nbsp;I close my eyes and, as always, the visions of Egypt&nbsp;come back. It&#x2019;s always to Egypt that my thoughts return.&nbsp;Even before I stood on its soil, I&#x2019;d dreamed&nbsp;about it. At six years old, I spotted a photograph of&nbsp;the Valley of the Kings on the cover of <i>National Geographic,&nbsp;</i>feeling instant recognition, as though I&nbsp;were looking at a familiar, much- beloved face that&nbsp;I had almost forgotten. That was what the land&nbsp;meant to me, a beloved face I longed to see again.&nbsp;And as the years progressed, I laid the foundations&nbsp;for my return. I worked and studied. A full scholarship&nbsp;brought me to Stanford, and to the attention&nbsp;of a professor who enthusiastically recommended&nbsp;me for a summer job at an excavation in Egypt&#x2019;s&nbsp;western desert.&nbsp;<br><br>In June, at the end of my ju nior year, I boarded a&nbsp;flight to Cairo.&nbsp;Even now, in the darkness of my California bedroom,&nbsp;I remember how my eyes ached from the&nbsp;sunlight glaring on white- hot sand. I smell the sunscreen&nbsp;on my skin and feel the sting of the wind&nbsp;peppering my face with desert grit. These memories&nbsp;make me happy. With a trowel in my hand and the&nbsp;sun on my shoulders, this was the culmination of a&nbsp;young girl&#x2019;s dreams.&nbsp;<br><br>How quickly dreams become nightmares. I&#x2019;d&nbsp;boarded the plane to Cairo as a happy college student.&nbsp;Three months later, I returned home a changed&nbsp;woman.&nbsp;<br><br>I did not come back from the desert alone. A&nbsp;monster followed me.&nbsp;<br><br>In the dark, my eyelids spring open. Was that a&nbsp;footfall? A door creaking open? I lie on damp&nbsp;sheets, heart battering itself against my chest. I am&nbsp;afraid to get out of bed, and afraid not to.&nbsp;<br><br>Something is not right in this house.&nbsp;<br><br>After years of hiding, I know better than to ignore&nbsp;the warning whispers in my head. Those urgent&nbsp;whispers are the only reason I am still alive. I&#x2019;ve&nbsp;learned to pay heed to every anomaly, every tremor&nbsp;of disquiet. I notice unfamiliar cars driving up my&nbsp;street. I snap to attention if a co- worker mentions&nbsp;that someone was asking about me. I make elaborate&nbsp;escape plans long before I ever need them. My&nbsp;next move is already planned out. In two hours, my&nbsp;daughter and I can be over the border and in Mexico&nbsp;with new identities. Our passports, with new&nbsp;names, are already tucked away in my suitcase.&nbsp;We should have left by now. We should not have&nbsp;waited this long.&nbsp;<br><br>But how do you convince a fourteen- year- old girl&nbsp;to move away from her friends? Tari is the problem;&nbsp;she does not understand the danger we&#x2019;re in.&nbsp;I pull open the nightstand drawer and take out the gun. It is not legally registered, and it makes me&nbsp;ner vous, keeping a firearm under the same roof with&nbsp;my daughter. But after six weekends at the shooting&nbsp;range, I know how to use it.&nbsp;<br><br>My bare feet are silent as I step out of my room&nbsp;and move down the hall, past my daughter&#x2019;s closed&nbsp;door. I conduct the same inspection that I have made&nbsp;a thousand times before, always in the dark. Like&nbsp;any prey, I feel safest in the dark.&nbsp;<br><br>In the kitchen, I check the windows and the door.&nbsp;In the living room, I do the same. Everything is secure.&nbsp;I come back up the hall and pause outside my&nbsp;daughter&#x2019;s bedroom. Tari has become fanatical&nbsp;about her privacy, but there is no lock on her door,&nbsp;and I will never allow there to be one. I need to be&nbsp;able to look in, to confirm that she is safe.&nbsp;<br><br>The door gives a loud squeak as I open it, but it&nbsp;won&#x2019;t wake her. As with most teenagers, her sleep is&nbsp;akin to a coma. The first thing I notice is the breeze,&nbsp;and I give a sigh. Once again, Tari has ignored my&nbsp;wishes and left her window wide open, as she has so&nbsp;many times before.&nbsp;<br><br>It feels like sacrilege, bringing the gun into my&nbsp;daughter&#x2019;s bedroom, but I need to close that window.&nbsp;I step inside and pause beside the bed, watching&nbsp;her sleep, listening to the steady rhythm of her&nbsp;breathing. I remember the first time I laid eyes on&nbsp;her, red- faced and crying in the obstetrician&#x2019;s&nbsp;hands. I had been in labor eigh teen hours, and was&nbsp;so exhausted I could barely lift my head from the&nbsp;pillow. But after one glimpse of my baby, I would&nbsp;have risen from bed and fought a legion of attackers&nbsp;to protect her. That was the moment I knew&nbsp;what her name would be. I thought of the words&nbsp;carved into the great temple at Abu Simbel, words&nbsp;chosen by Ramses the Great to proclaim his love for&nbsp;his wife.&nbsp;<br><br>Nefertari, for whom the sun doth shine&nbsp;<br><br>My daughter, Nefertari, is the one and only trea -&nbsp;sure that I brought back with me from Egypt. And&nbsp;I am terrified of losing her.&nbsp;<br><br>Tari is so much like me. It&#x2019;s as if I am watching&nbsp;myself sleeping. When she was ten years old, she&nbsp;could already read hieroglyphs. At twelve, she could&nbsp;recite all the dynasties down to the Ptolemys. She&nbsp;spends her weekends haunting the Museum of&nbsp;Man. She is a clone of me in every way, and as the&nbsp;years pass there is no obvious trace of her father in&nbsp;her face or her voice or, most important of all, her&nbsp;soul. She is my daughter, mine alone, untainted by&nbsp;the evil that fathered her.&nbsp;<br><br>But she is also a normal fourteen- year- old girl,&nbsp;and this has been a source of frustration these past&nbsp;weeks as I&#x2019;ve felt darkness closing in around us, as&nbsp;I lie awake every night, listening for a monster&#x2019;s&nbsp;footsteps. My daughter is oblivious to the danger&nbsp;because I have hidden the truth from her. I want&nbsp;her to grow up strong and fearless, a warrior&nbsp;woman who is unafraid of shadows. She does not&nbsp;understand why I pace the house late at night, why&nbsp;I latch the windows and double- check the doors.&nbsp;She thinks I am a worrywart, and it&#x2019;s true: I do all&nbsp;the worrying for both of us, to preserve the illusion&nbsp;that all is right with the world.&nbsp;<br><br>That is what Tari believes. She likes San Diego and&nbsp;she looks forward to her first year in high school.&nbsp;She&#x2019;s managed to make friends here, and heaven&nbsp;help the parent who tries to come between a teenager&nbsp;and her friends. She is as strong- willed as I am, and&nbsp;were it not for her re sis tance, we would have left&nbsp;town weeks ago.&nbsp;<br><br>A breeze blows in the window, chilling the sweat&nbsp;on my skin.&nbsp;<br><br>I set the gun down on the nightstand and cross&nbsp;to the window to close it. For a moment I linger,&nbsp;breathing in cool air. Outside, the night has fallen&nbsp;silent, except for a mosquito&#x2019;s whine. A prick stings&nbsp;my cheek.

Like Saint-Simon at Versailles, Samuel Pepys during the Great Fire of London, or the Goncourt brothers in nineteenth-century France, Lucie Dillon&#x2014;a daughter of French and British nobility known in France by her married name, Lucie de la Tour du Pin&#x2014;was the chronicler of her age.</p><p>La Rochefoucauld called her "a cultural jewel." The Sultan of the Ottoman Empire favored her for his dinner companion in Paris. Napoleon requested she attend Josephine. Her friends included Talleyrand, Madame de Sta�l, Chateaubriand, Lafayette, and the Duke of Wellington, with whom she played as a child. She witnessed firsthand the demise of the French monarchy, the wave of Revolution and the Reign of Terror, and the precipitous rise and fall of Napoleon. She spent two years as an �migr� in the newly independent United States (on a farm in Albany) but was also a familiar of Regency London. A shrewd, determined woman in a turbulent age of men, Lucie de la Tour du Pin watched, listened, reflected&#x2014;and wrote it all down, mixing politics and court intrigue, social observation and the realities of everyday existence, to offer a fascinating chronicle of her era.</p><p>In this compelling biography, Caroline Moorehead illuminates the extraordinary life and remarkable achievements of this strong, witty, elegant, opinionated, and dynamic woman who survived personal tragedy, including the loss of six children, and periods of extreme danger, exile, poverty, and illness. Meticulously researched, brilliantly written, and vastly entertaining, Moorehead's chronicle of Lucie's life is an incomparable social history of her times.</p><p>Caroline Moorehead is the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>Village of Secrets: Defying the Nazis in Vichy France</em>; <em>A Train in Winter: An Extraordinary Story of Women, Friendship, and Resistance in Occupied France</em>; and <em>Human Cargo: A Journey Among Refugees</em>, which was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. An acclaimed biographer, Moorehead has also written for the <em>New York Review of Books</em>, the <em>Guardian</em>, the <em>Times</em>, and the <em>Independent</em>.

Chester, who has been reading avidly about the paranormal, predicts that they will soon be traveling someplace, and chances are they are not going to like it. <br>Indeed they are not, as the very next day, with the sun shining bright and clear, the Monroes finally leave for their vacation, dropping Chester, Harold, and Howie off at the scene of some previous harrowing experiences -- Chateau Bow-Wow, the boarding kennel that Chester so aptly had dubbed "Howliday Inn." <br>And this visit promises to be no less harrowing than the last one. The three are greeted by a whole new group of temporary residents. There's Hamlet, the Great Dane, whose sadness grows deeper with his certainty that his beloved master Archie will never return to pick him up. And Bob and Linda, a pair of yuppie puppies from fashionable Upper Centerville who have been left at Chateau Bow-Wow with a more than adequate supply of gourmet treats, also seem to have been left with a more than adequate supply of worries. Then there are Felony and Miss Demeanor, sinister sisters in crime who pride themselves as cat burglars, and The Weasel who tries almost too hard to make a good impression. <br>Chester is certain that nothing bodes well and he is right. Unexplained voices, buried bones, a collar with the name Rosebud on it, and a secret code all make for a paranormal experience that none of the guests at Chateau Bow-Wow will ever forget.</p><p>Approx. 2 hours<br>2 cassettes<br>Performance by Victor Garber<br><br>Chester, who has been reading avidly about the paranormal, predicts that they will soon be traveling someplace, and chances are they are not going to like it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed they are not, as the very next day, the Monroes leave for their vacation, dropping Chester, Harold, and Howie off at the scene of some previous harrowing experiences - Chateau Bow-Wow, the boarding kennel that Chester so aptly had dubbed "Howliday Inn."&nbsp;&nbsp;And this visit promises to be no less harrowing than the last one.James Howe&nbsp;is the author of more than ninety books for young readers.&nbsp;<i>Bunnicula</i>, coauthored by his late wife Deborah and published in 1979, is considered a modern classic of children&#x2019;s literature.

After five years of rejection and one complete revision, Heller's first book,&nbsp;<i>Chickens Aren't the Only Ones</i>, about egg-laying animals, was published in 1981. It was so successful that the sequel, and second book to be published,&nbsp;<i>Animals Born Alive And Well</i>&nbsp;(1982), about mammals, quickly followed. In 1983 and 1984, her third and fourth titles,&nbsp;<i>The Reason For A Flower</i>&nbsp;(about plants that have seeds and flowers) and&nbsp;<i>Plants That Never Ever Bloom</i>&nbsp;(about plants that do not) were published.<br> <br> She then began work on a collection of six books, the&nbsp;<i>How To Hide</i>&nbsp;series on camouflage and the magic of this phenomenon in nature, which covered the entire animal kingdom -- insects, birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and sea creatures. The next collection of books became a five-volume series on parts of speech:&nbsp;<i>A Cache of Jewels and Other Collective Nouns; Kites Sail High: A Book About Verbs; Many Luscious Lollipops: A Book About Adjectives; Merry-Go-Round: A Book About Nouns;</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Up, Up and Away: A Book About Adverbs</i>. She also wrote and illustrated the unique and fascinating book&nbsp;<i>Color</i>, a charming and instructive guide to how art goes through the four color printing process.<br> <br> Among the notable people who have had an influence on Heller's writing have been: Ogden Nash, Gilbert and Sullivan, Edward Lear, Hilaire Belloc, and Dr. Seuss. Heller says of her work, "All my books are nonfiction picture books in rhyme. I find writing in rhyme enjoyable and challenging, and I think it is an easy way for children to learn new facts and acquire a sophisticated vocabulary. Children are not intimidated by big words. I try to make my writing succinct and allow the illustrations to convey as much information as possible."To further a child's grasp of the meaning and function of adjectives, this gorgeous picture book provides enrichment and depth of understanding. As in her other pictorial explorations of parts of speech, Kites Sail High (verbs) and A Cache of Jewels (collective nouns), Heller uses a rhymed text in juxtaposition with bold, brilliant, double-page spreads. These books are a visual and auditory feast, designed to make language discovery appealing and rewarding. Young readers will certainly enjoy--and benefit from--Heller's elegant elucidations, and perhaps all should heed her parting advice: "Whenever you find yourself in doubt / be cautious and be wary. / It's often very helpful / to consult your dictionary."

Once upon a time before crack, pride and style were as inseparable as a beatbox and mixtape, or as a pair of shoes and matching purse. Once upon a time before crack, Jamel Shabazz was on the scene, working the streets of New York City, capturing the faces and places of an era that have long since disappeared. <br> <br>Best known as Hip Hop&#x2019;s finest fashion photographer for his blockbuster best-selling monograph, <i>Back in the Days</i> (powerHouse Books, 2001), Shabazz revisited his archive and unearthed an extraordinary collection of never-before-published documentary photographs collected for his third powerHouse Books release, <b><i>A Time Before Crack</i></b>, a visual diary of the streets of New York City from the mid-seventies to the mid-eighties, Shabazz&#x2019;s distinctive photographs reveal the families, the poses, and the players who made this age extraordinary.</p><p><b>Jamel Shabazz</b> is the author of <i>Back in the Days</i> (powerHouse Books, 2001) and <i>The Last Sunday in June</i> (powerHouse Books, 2003). His photographs have appeared in publications including <i>The Source</i>, <i>Vibe</i>, <i>TRACE</i>, <i>Flaunt</i>, <i>Mass Appeal</i>, <i>Jalouse</i>, <i>Black Book</i>, <i>OneWorld</i>, and <i>Honey</i>. Shabazz&#x2019;s work has been exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Kravets/Wehby Gallery, New York; by Kangol at the Dazed &amp; Confused Gallery, London; by adidas and Lodown at adidas Originals, Berlin; and in Trace&#x2019;s True Signs, Paris. His debut book, <i>Back in the Days</i>, has received astounding critical acclaim and commercial success since its initial release in January 2001. Shabazz was born in Brooklyn and lives in Long Island, New York. <br><br> <b>Claude Grunitzky</b> is chairman and Editor-in-Chief of <i>TRACE magazine </i>and chairman of <i>TRUE Agency</i>, a specialized advertising and marketing shop partnered with Omnicom&#x2019;s <i>TBWAChiatDay</i>. <br><br> <b>James "Koe" Rodriguez</b> is an artist, writer, and faithful hip-hopper. His latest project is a documentary film on legendary New York photographers Ernie Paniccioli, Jamel Shabazz, and Joe Conzo titled<i> 1 LOVE</i>. <br><br> <b>Charlie Ahearn</b> is the director of the classic, 1982 Hip Hop movie <i>Wild Style</i>. He is the coauthor of <i>Yes Yes Y&#x2019;all</i> (Da Capo, 2002) and currently hosts an eponymously named Internet radio show on <i>wps1.org</i>. <br><br> <b>Terrence Jennings</b>&#x2019; photographs have been published in <i>TRACE</i>, <i>The Source</i>, <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Observer of London</i>, and <i>Black: A Celebration of a Culture</i> (Hylas, 2004).Following up on his powerHouse titles Back in the Days (2001) and Last Sunday in June (2003), Shabazz delivers another set of photographs taken of nascent hip-culture circa 1979-1985. Nearly all of the 150 photos here are individual or group portraits; most are of young people in the streets; all reflect Shabazz's extraordinary rapport with his subjects-even when the latter are striking a defiant pose. The book offers a panorama of New York's African-American style of the era: Puma-hatted men with over-sized glasses, women in tight demin with white stitching, kente-clothed women, giant boom boxes, light brown glossy leather and painted denim jackets, big gold chains and earings, tiny shorts-and even a kind of Izod-Lacosted formality the pervaded the scene before the absolute dominance of athletic wear. As far as the title's implication of a more innocent time go: it's indeed impossible to anticipate the coming effects of crack on New York from look at these pictures, and ways in which Shabazz's subjects face the camera does feel less mediated than what he might get now walking down the street in Bed-Stuy, making this book a multi-layered time capsule. Also included are essays by Wild Style director Charlie Ahearn and photographer Terrance Jennings, an introduction by TRACE magazine editor-in-chief Claude Grunitzky and an afterword by artist James "Koe" Rodriguez. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Recipes, which include apple cider-smoked trout with horseradish cream and fresh corn and smoked clam cakes with ancho chile sauce, are supplemented by information-packed tips and guidance, such as an overview of different oyster varieties in North America and guidelines for healthy grilling and smoking. Chapters on marinades, rubs, sauces, and side dishes help readers build sumptuous, complete meals.Recipes include: Grilled Tuna with Fresh Peach and Onion Relish Salmon with Tunisian Spiced Vegetables Teriyaki Stir-Grilled Mahimahi Tequila-Lime Grilled Shrimp Latin Lover&#39;s Grilled Baby Squid Balsamic Smoked Haddock Apple Cider-Smoked Trout with Horseradish Cream Fresh Corn and Smoked Clam Cake with Ancho Chili Sauce Smoked Scallops with Citrus Vinaigrette Orange and Red Onion Salad Parmesan-Crusted Tomatoes</p><p>Fish, often bottom-billed in many barbecue and grilling cookbooks with a few token recipes, succeeds spectacularly as the star of the show in <i>Fish &amp; Shellfish, Grilled &amp; Smoked</i>. Authors Karen Adler and Judith M. Fertig--Kansas City foodies and members of an all-women barbecue team called the 'Que Queens--argue that fresh fish and shellfish are a healthier option to other traditional barbecue meats due to their low-fat, low-calorie qualities. There's also wonderful variety, as demonstrated by the 300 recipes--presented in a clean, eye-pleasing layout--that pack this book. Standouts, and there are many, include Cape Cod Blackfish ("mild-flavored yet firm and meaty"); Grilled Baby Squid, brushed with olive oil, garlic, and paprika; and North Woods Smoked Walleye, marinated in wheat beer and served over mixed greens. "Fish Tales," sidebars of fish facts and history that pop up throughout, are a nice touch. There's also a funny story about the authors' reluctance to include a smoked-eel recipe. ("First of all, you have to buy a live eel. That means 30 minutes with a live eel squirming in a plastic bag next to the driver.") In addition, for folks who have a hard time getting fresh fish locally, there's a handy list of fish purveyors. This is a terrific cookbook that would fit nicely on any griller's bookshelf. <i>--Andy Boynton</i>Judith and I are the BBQ Queens. We have co-authored 10 cookbooks together. Fish &amp; Shellfish Grilled &amp; Smoked was our third collaboration and one of our finest. We both feel this is the most complete book written about grilling and smoking the most extensive list of fish a shellfish. Our book is sustainable, too, as we follow the guidelines of the Seafood Conservancy by listing several alternative fish or shellfish that can be substituted in every recipe, plus a fish and shellfish substitution chart.<br>The book includes some of our most favorite recipes like Planked Scallops with Bearnaise Butter, the Stir-Grilled Fish Tacos with a Napa Cabbage Slaw, Provencal Grilled Shrimp and Pasta Gratin, Salmon Charmoula, Swordfish with Tarragon Beurre Blanc, and Amaretto-Basted Walleye.<br>We have great sauces and side dishes, too, like Sun-Dried Tomato Rouille, Ancho Chili Sauce, Mediterranean Orzo Salad, Grilled Corn in the Husk, and Chinese Grilled Asparagus.<br>We both love French and Italian cuisine and have spent wonderful vacations in Paris, Burgundy, Provence, Maritime Alps, Tuscany, and other parts of Italy, as well as Spain and Portugal.

She had lengthened the chain so she could wear them both at once, not being willing to part with either. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t think, perhaps, that the lace is a trifle too much adornment?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not at all!&#x201d; Charlotte sat back, one hand resting protectively, unconsciously, over her belly. She had always been too slim&#x2014;skinny, in truth&#x2014;to really need a corset, and now that she was going to have a child, she had taken to wearing tea gowns, in which she looked like a little bird. &#x201c;It is your wedding day, Tessa. If there is ever an excuse for excessive adornment, it is that. Just imagine it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tessa had spent many nights doing just that. She was not yet sure where she and Jem would be married, for the Council was still deliberating their situation. But when she imagined the wedding, it was always in a church, with her being marched down the aisle, perhaps on Henry&#x2019;s arm, looking neither to the left or right but straight ahead at her betrothed, as a proper bride should. Jem would be wearing gear&#x2014;not the sort one fought in, but specially designed, in the manner of a military uniform, for the occasion: black with bands of gold at the wrists, and gold runes picked out along the collar and placket.<br> <br>He would look so young. They were both so young. Tessa knew it was unusual to marry at seventeen and eighteen, but they were racing a clock.<br> <br>The clock of Jem&#x2019;s life, before it wound down.<br> <br>She put her hand to her throat, and felt the familiar vibration of her clockwork angel, its wings scratching her palm. The seamstress looked up at her anxiously. She was mundane, not Nephilim, but had the Sight, as all who served the Shadowhunters did. &#x201c;Would you like the lace removed, miss?&#x201d;<br> <br>Before Tessa could answer, there was a knock at the door, and a familiar voice. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Jem. Tessa, are you there?&#x201d;<br> <br>Charlotte sat bolt upright. &#x201c;Oh! He mustn&#x2019;t see you in your dress!&#x201d;<br> <br>Tessa stood dumbfounded. &#x201c;Whyever not?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a Shadowhunter custom&#x2014;bad luck!&#x201d; Charlotte rose to her feet. &#x201c;Quickly! Hide behind the wardrobe!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The wardrobe? But&#x2014;&#x201d; Tessa broke off with a yelp as Charlotte seized her about the waist and frog-marched her behind the wardrobe like a policeman with a particularly resistant criminal. Released, Tessa dusted off her dress and made a face at Charlotte, and they both peeked around the side of the furniture as the seamstress, after a bewildered look, opened the door.<br> <br>Jem&#x2019;s silvery head appeared in the gap. He looked a bit disheveled, his jacket askew. He glanced around in puzzlement before his gaze lighted on Charlotte and Tessa, half-concealed behind the wardrobe. &#x201c;Thank goodness,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d no idea where any of you had gone. Gabriel Lightwood&#x2019;s downstairs, and he&#x2019;s making the most dreadful row.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;Write to them, Will,&#x201d; said Cecily Herondale. &#x201c;Please. Just one letter.&#x201d;<br> <br>Will tossed his sweat-soaked dark hair back and glared at her. &#x201c;Get your feet into position,&#x201d; was all he said. He pointed, with the tip of his dagger. &#x201c;There, and there.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cecily sighed, and moved her feet. She had known she was out of position; she&#x2019;d been doing it intentionally, to needle Will. It was easy to needle her brother. That much she remembered about him from when he was twelve years old. Even then daring him to do something, like climb the steeply pitched roof of their manor house, had resulted in the same thing: an angry blue flame in his eyes, a set jaw, and sometimes Will with a broken leg or arm at the end of it.<br> <br>Of course this brother, the nearly adult Will, was not the brother she remembered from her childhood. He had grown both more explosive and more withdrawn. He had all their mother&#x2019;s beauty, and all their father&#x2019;s stubbornness&#x2014;and, she feared, their father&#x2019;s propensity for vices, though she had guessed that only from whispers among the occupants of the Institute.<br> <br>&#x201c;Raise your blade,&#x201d; Will said. His voice was as cool and professional as her governess&#x2019;s.<br> <br>Cecily raised it. It had taken her some time to get used to the feel of gear against her skin: the loose tunic and trousers, the belt around her waist. Now she moved in it as comfortably as she had ever moved in the loosest nightgown. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand why you won&#x2019;t consider writing a letter. A single letter.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand why you won&#x2019;t consider going home,&#x201d; Will said. &#x201c;If you would just agree to return to Yorkshire yourself, you could stop worrying about our parents and I could arrange&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Cecily interrupted him, having heard this speech a thousand times. &#x201c;Would you consider a wager, Will?&#x201d;<br> <br>Cecily was both pleased and a little disappointed to see Will&#x2019;s eyes spark, just the way her father&#x2019;s always did when a gentleman&#x2019;s bet was suggested. Men were so easy to predict.<br> <br>&#x201c;What sort of a wager?&#x201d; Will took a step forward. He was wearing gear; Cecily could see the Marks that twined his wrists, the mnemosyne rune on his throat. It had taken her some time to see the Marks as something other than disfiguring, but she was used to them now&#x2014;as she had grown used to the gear, to the great echoing halls of the Institute, and to its peculiar denizens.<br> <br>She pointed at the wall in front of them. An ancient target had been painted on the wall in black: a bull&#x2019;s-eye inside a larger circle. &#x201c;If I hit the center of that three times, you have to write a letter to Dad and Mam and tell them how you are. You must tell them of the curse and why you left.&#x201d;<br> <br>Will&#x2019;s face closed like a door, the way it always did when she made this request. But, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll never hit it three times without missing, Cecy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, then it should be no great concern to you to make the bet, William.&#x201d; She used his full name purposefully. She knew it bothered him, coming from her, though when his best friend&#x2014;no, his parabatai; she had learned since coming to the Institute that these were quite different things&#x2014;Jem did it, Will seemed to take it as a term of affection. Possibly it was because he still had memories of her toddling after him on chubby legs, calling Will, Will, after him in breathless Welsh. She had never called him &#x201c;William,&#x201d; only ever &#x201c;Will&#x201d; or his Welsh name, Gwilym.<br> <br>His eyes narrowed, those dark blue eyes the same color as her own. When their mother had said affectionately that Will would be a breaker of hearts when he was grown, Cecily had always looked at her dubiously. Will had been all arms and legs then, skinny and disheveled and always dirty. She could see it now, though, had seen it when she had first walked into the dining room of the Institute and he had stood up in astonishment, and she had thought: That can&#x2019;t be Will.<br> <br>He had turned those eyes on her, her mother&#x2019;s eyes, and she had seen the anger in them. He had not been pleased to see her, not at all. And where in her memories there had been a skinny boy with a wild tangle of black hair like a Gypsy&#x2019;s and leaves in his clothes, there was now this tall, frightening man instead. The words she had wanted to say had dissolved on her tongue, and she had matched him, glare for glare. And so it had been since, Will barely enduring her presence as if she were a stone in his shoe, a constant but minor annoyance.<br> <br>Cecily took a deep breath, raised her chin, and prepared to throw the first knife. Will did not know, would never know, of the hours she had spent in this room, alone, practicing, learning to balance the weight of the knife in her hand, discovering that a good knife throw began from behind the body. She held both arms straight down and drew her right arm back, behind her head, before bringing it, and the weight of her body, forward. The tip of the knife was in line with the target. She released it and snapped her hand back, sucking in a gasp.<br> <br>The knife stuck, point-down in the wall, exactly in the center of the target.<br> <br>&#x201c;One,&#x201d; Cecily said, giving Will a superior smile.<br> <br>He looked at her stonily, yanked the knife from the wall, and handed it to her again.<br> <br>Cecily threw it. The second throw, like the first, flew directly to its target and stuck there, vibrating like a mocking finger.<br> <br>&#x201c;Two,&#x201d; Cecily said in a sepulchral tone.<br> <br>Will&#x2019;s jaw set as he took the knife again and presented it to her. She took it with a smile. Confidence was flowing through her veins like new blood. She knew she could do this. She had always been able to climb as high as Will, run as fast, hold her breath as long.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>She threw the knife. It struck its target, and she leaped into the air, clapping her hands, forgetting herself for a moment in the thrill of victory. Her hair came down from its pins and spilled into her face; she pushed it back and grinned at Will. &#x201c;You shall write that letter. You agreed to the bet!&#x201d;<br> <br>To her surprise he smiled at her. &#x201c;Oh, I will write it,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I will write it, and then I will throw it into the fire.&#x201d; He held up a hand against her outburst of indignation. &#x201c;I said I would write it. I never said I would send it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cecily&#x2019;s breath went out of her in a gasp. &#x201c;How dare you trick me like that!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I told you that you were not made of Shadowhunter stuff, or you would not be so easily fooled. I am not going to write a letter, Cecy. It&#x2019;s against the Law, and that&#x2019;s the end of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;As if you care about the Law!&#x201d; Cecily stamped her foot, and was immediately more annoyed than ever; she detested girls who stamped their feet.<br> <br>Will&#x2019;s eyes narrowed. &#x201c;And you don&#x2019;t care about being a Shadowhunter. How is this? I shall write a letter and give it to you if you promise to deliver it home yourself&#x2014;and not to return.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cecily recoiled. She had many memories of shouting matches with Will, of the china dolls she had owned that he had broken by dropping them out an attic window, but there was also kindness in her memories&#x2014;the brother who had bandaged up a cut knee, or retied her hair ribbons when they had come loose. That kindness was absent from the Will who stood before her now. Mam used to cry for the first year or two after Will went; she had said, holding Cecily to her, that the Shadowhunters would &#x201c;take all the love out of him.&#x201d; A cold people, she had told Cecily, a people who had forbidden her marriage to her husband. What could he want with them, her Will, her little one?<br> <br>&#x201c;I will not go,&#x201d; Cecily said, staring her brother down. &#x201c;And if you insist that I must, I will&#x2014;I will&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>The door of the attic slid open, and Jem stood silhouetted in the doorway. &#x201c;Ah,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;threatening each other, I see. Has this been going on all afternoon, or did it just begin?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He began it,&#x201d; Cecily said, jerking her chin at Will, though she knew it was pointless. Jem, Will&#x2019;s parabatai, treated her with the distant sweet kindness reserved for the little sisters of one&#x2019;s friends, but he would always side with Will. Kindly, but firmly, he put Will above everything else in the world.<br> <br>Well, nearly everything. She had been most struck by Jem when she first came to the Institute&#x2014;he had an unearthly, unusual beauty, with his silvery hair and eyes and delicate features. He looked like a prince in a fairy-tale book, and she might have considered developing an attachment to him, were it not so absolutely clear that he was entirely in love with Tessa Gray. His eyes followed her where she went, and his voice changed when he spoke to her. Cecily had once heard her mother say in amusement that one of their neighbors&#x2019; boys looked at a girl as if she were &#x201c;the only star in the sky&#x201d; and that was the way Jem looked at Tessa.<br> <br>Cecily didn&#x2019;t resent it: Tessa was pleasant and kind to her, if a little shy, and with her face always stuck in a book, like Will. If that was the sort of girl Jem wanted, she and he never would have suited&#x2014;and the longer she remained at the Institute, the more she realized how awkward it would have made things with Will. He was ferociously protective of Jem, and he would have watched her constantly in case she ever distressed or hurt him in any way. No&#x2014;she was far better out of the whole thing.<br> <br>&#x201c;I was just thinking of bundling up Cecily and feeding her to the ducks in Hyde Park,&#x201d; said Will, pushing his wet hair back and favoring Jem with a rare smile. &#x201c;I could use your assistance.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Unfortunately, you may have to delay your plans for sororicide a bit longer. Gabriel Lightwood is downstairs, and I have two words for you. Two of your favorite words, at least when you put them together.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;&nbsp;&#x2018;Utter simpleton&#x2019;?&#x201d; inquired Will. &#x201c;&nbsp;&#x2018;Worthless upstart&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jem grinned. &#x201c;&nbsp;&#x2018;Demon pox,&#x2019;&nbsp;&#x201d; he said.<br> <br><br> <br>Sophie balanced the salver on one hand with the ease of long practice while she rapped on Gideon Lightwood&#x2019;s door with the other.<br> <br>She heard the sound of a hurried shuffle, and the door swung open. Gideon stood before her in trousers, braces, and a white shirt rolled up to the elbows. His hands were wet, as if he had just run quick fingers through his hair, which was also damp. Her heart took a little leap inside her chest before settling. She forced herself to frown at him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Lightwood,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve brought the scones you rang for, and Bridget&#x2019;s made you up a plate of sandwiches as well.&#x201d;<br> <br>Gideon took a step back to allow her into the room. It was like all the other rooms in the Institute: heavy dark furniture, a great four-poster bed, a wide fireplace, and high windows, which in this case looked down upon the courtyard below. Sophie could feel his gaze on her as she moved across the room to place the salver on the table before the fire. She straightened up and turned to him, her hands folded in front of her apron.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sophie&#x2014;,&#x201d; he began.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mr. Lightwood,&#x201d; she interrupted. &#x201c;Is there anything else you require?&#x201d;<br> <br>He looked at her half-mutinously, half-sadly. &#x201c;I wish you would call me Gideon.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I have told you, I cannot call you by your Christian name.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I am a Shadowhunter; I do not have a Christian name.

He grew to be handsome, strong, and intelligent--but also arrogant and cold. When he joined King Arthur&#39;s Round Table, his prowess as a warrior was unquestioned. But he had forgotten two of the most important qualities of a truly great knight: mercy and tenderness. This is the story of young Lancelot and his quest to become the greatest knight of all--a knight both brave and kind.</p><p>Grade 3-5-San Souci continues his retellings of Arthurian legends. Lancelot is raised by the Lady of the Lake in her enchanted kingdom. Never revealing his true name or that he is the son of a king, she wants him to become an intelligent, caring warrior, but instead he becomes hardhearted and arrogant. When he hears of King Arthur's Round Table, he wants the chance to meet his destiny. His arrogance wins him no friends there, but Arthur allows him to tackle two difficult tasks to prove his worth. He conquers an evil knight and two giants easily, but falls short when battling black knights at Chapel Perilous. Lancelot feels sorry for himself at being defeated, but then has a soul-changing revelation. With his new attitude, he overcomes the black knights. His change comes too swiftly to ring true for someone with a heart that's "diamond-hard." Also, despite the use of vivid action verbs and strong descriptors, the two tasks are described too simplistically and without enough gritty conflict to make them interesting. The illustrations are colorful but do not reinforce the text: facial expressions are sometimes weak and unrepresentative of the action.<br><i>Cheri Estes, Detroit Country Day School Middle School, Beverly Hills, MI</i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.From the collaborators behind Young Guinevere (1993), a version of the story of Lancelot, orphaned and raised by Niniane, the Lady of the Lake. Sent to King Arthur for training, the young man excels, but his cold and arrogant ways make him enemies. When allowed to test himself, he succeeds twice; a third test eludes him until he sees how selfish he has been. The prose is mannered, with words and phrases that set the mood yet do not obscure the tale. Although the illustrations are colorful and filled with enticing details on medieval costumes, embroidery, tapestry, and decoration, the action and characters can appear quite static. Some of the people are listless in their poses, staring inexplicably into the distance; others are done as full frontal portraits, gazing out at readers; still others--the wailing of a widow, a battle with a giant--interrupt the sheer elegance of the telling with melodrama.

The science of inner alchemy consists of meditation practices that enable the individual to have a more intimate, energizing, and inspiring relationship with life. Although these techniques are described in the sourcebooks of ancient Taoism, they are often couched in cryptic symbolic language, making it difficult for today's seekers t put these teachings into practice. Some classical Taoist writers, however, did adopt a more explicit manner of expression. <i>Practical Taoism </i> is a collection of writings from these more accessible commentators on the traditional alchemical texts, compiled by a seventh-generation master of the Northern Branch of the Complete Reality School of Taoism known as the Preserver of Truth.</p><p>Thomas Cleary holds a PhD in East Asian Languages and Civilizations from Harvard University and a JD from the University of California, Berkeley, Boalt Hall School of Law.

But whether or not we have expected the death of our parents after a prolonged illness, were close to or alienated from them, this passage is inevitably harder than we thought it would be.A much needed and knowing discussion of this adult phenomenon, <i>The Orphaned Adult</i> validates the wide array of disorienting emotions that can accompany the death of our parents by sharing both the author's heart-felt experience of loss and the moving stories of countless adults who have shared their losses with him. From the recognition of our own mortality and sudden child-like sorrow to a sometimes-subtle change in identity or shift of roles in the surviving family, <i>The Orphaned Adult</i> guides readers through the storm of change this passage brings and anchors them with its compassionate and reassuring wisdom.</p><p>Alexander Levy has been a psychologist in private practice for over twenty years. He lives on a farm in Pennsylvania.The death of one's parents is "the ultimate equal-opportunity" experience; becoming an orphan as an adult happens to nearly everybody. Yet despite the flood of self-help books on death and the grieving process, very little (with the exception of Hope Edleman's Motherless Daughters) has been written on parental loss. Incorporating his own personal experience with the accounts of others who have lost their parents, psychologist Levy examines this profound life-changing event with compassion and understanding. Since our parents "project an illusion of permanence," writes Levy, their death forces us to confront our own mortality (we are next in line to die) and to adjust to our new identities as orphaned adults. Indeed, he argues that this stripping of our childish beliefs is the first step toward true adulthood: "Perhaps only after parents have died can people find out what they are going to be when they grow up."

When The Salvation Army, a British evangelical movement, landed in New York in 1880, local citizens called its eye-catching advertisements "vulgar" and dubbed its brass bands, female preachers, and overheated services "sensationalist." Yet a little more than a century later, this ragtag missionary movement had evolved into the nation's largest charitable fund-raiser--the very exemplar of America's most cherished values of social service and religious commitment. </p><p> Winston illustrates how the Army borrowed the forms and idioms of popular entertainments, commercial emporiums, and master marketers to deliver its message. In contrast to histories that relegate religion to the sidelines of urban society, her book shows that Salvationists were at the center of debates about social services for the urban poor, the changing position of women, and the evolution of a consumer culture. She also describes Salvationist influence on contemporary life--from the public's post-World War I (and ongoing) love affair with the doughnut to the Salvationist young woman's career as a Hollywood icon to the institutionalization of religious ideals into nonsectarian social programs. </p><p> Winston's vivid account of a street savvy religious mission transformed over the decades makes adroit use of performance theory and material culture studies to create an evocative portrait of a beloved yet little understood religious movement. Her book provides striking evidence that, counter to conventional wisdom, religion was among the seminal social forces that shaped modern, urban America--and, in the process, found new expression for its own ideals. </p></p><p>The first Salvation Army kettle, complete with attendant bell-ringer, appeared on the streets of San Francisco in 1891. The slogan, "Fill the Pot for the Poor--Free Dinner on Christmas Day," has changed, but the practice hasn't. Starting with the Army's arrival in the United States in 1880 and describing its activities through World War II, Diane Winston's <i>Red-Hot and Righteous</i> follows the Army's missions, methods, and spectacular growth.<p> William Booth, who founded the Army in Britain in 1878, believed he needed to take religion to the people and urged his followers to imagine a "cathedral of the open air." Salvation Army preachers became a common sight in the streets of New York. Conservative Christians were upset by the public spectacle; the Army, however, happily banged cymbals, beat drums, and sang--their goal was to attract attention. Using contemporary advertising techniques, pageants, and parades, the Salvation Army made a vibrant mark on the urban scene and the American consciousness. Over time the Army's focus shifted from proselytizing to practical religion: gaining converts through religiously motivated social programs. Soup kitchens, homeless shelters, coal in winter--the Army offered relief to all, regardless of race, religion, or creed. Its greatest success, however, came when it sent 250 workers, including a few dozen women, to Europe to provide a little bit of home to the boys fighting in the Great War. With their trays of doughnuts and pitchers of coffee, the "Sallies" boosted morale and earned the Salvation Army a tremendous amount of respect. Winston's book reveals that she, too, respects both the Army's mission and its theology, and she tells its story with graceful prose. <i>Red-Hot and Righteous</i> will interest scholars of religious movements and 19th-century urban life alike. <i>--C.B. Delaney</i></p>In this engrossing study of religion, urban life, and commercial culture, Diane Winston shows how a (self-styled &#34;red-hot&#34;) militant Protestant mission established a beachhead in the modern city.</p><h2>Christian Liberty Nature Reader Book 1</h2><p>This completely revised, full-color text develops better reading skills by reinforcing phonics principles through stories that pique young minds-stories about insects, spiders, birds, and other animals.

This second of two volumes on Revelation offers a systematic and thorough interpretation of the latter chapters of the book. Revelation brings together the worlds of heaven, earth and hell in a final confrontation between the forces of good and evil. Its characters and images are both real and symbolic, spiritual and material, and it is frequently difficult to know the difference between them,</p><p>Revelation's cryptic nature has ensure that it would always be a source of controversy. This commentary focuses on the theological content, gleaning the best from both the classical and modern commentary traditions and showing the doctrinal development of Scriptural truths. Scholarship on the book of Revelation has nonetheless not only endured, but even captured the imagination of generations of Bible students, both professionals and laypeople alike. Through its focus on the message of the book through scholarly analysis, this ITC reconnects to the ecclesial tradition of biblical commentary as an effort in ressourcement, though not slavish repetition.</p></p><p>A theological verse-by-verse commentary on the book of Revelation which complements our prestigous International Critical Commentary series.<b>Peter J.

This book, more than any other we know, traces the steps that went into that revolution and simultaneously makes the argument that the letter forms themselves are in process of evolution. Tracy argues that, whether they are of the sixteenth or the twentieth century, the forms that comprise our alphabet are subject to the same rules of good taste, proportion, and clarity that have always obtained. But what we face today is vastly different from fifty years ago. For the first time, new technology has made the proliferation (and, as some would maintain, debasement) of letter forms fast and easy (or quick and dirty.) <br><br>With fifty years of professional experience on both sides of the Atlantic (including thirty years as head of type design for the British Linotype Company), Tracy is in a unique position to make this argument and arrive at his sad conclusion: the design of distinguished, contemporary typefaces is far outnumbered by the mediocre and downright bad. Part of the reason for this deplorable deterioration is a lack of critical analysis of the particular esthetics involved. This step-by-step examination of type-design esthetics is precisely what Tracy provides here, while avoiding both the promoter's hype and the manufacturer's claims. Here are the gut issues of what makes type good or bad, legible or unreadable. Extensively illustrated with both typefaces and line drawings, this book belongs on the shelf of anyone interested in thehistory of letters or in the artistry and peculiar problems that lie behind their production.</p><p>Typographer, writer, and designer of books, magazines, and newspapers, Walter Tracy was born in 1914 and began his career as a compositor. After several years in advertising, he went on to direct the English Linotype letter design program from 1947 to the mid-1970s. He served as typographic adviser to the London Times after Stanley Morison&#39;s death, where he adapted Morison&#39;s Times New Roman designs for the demands of modern printing. A specialist in typefaces for newspapers, Tracy also designed a number of particularly successful non-roman faces. He died in 1995.</p><h2>Ellies Story</h2><p>Ellie&#39;s Story is a heartwarming illustrated novel adapted for young readers from the beloved and New York Times bestselling A Dog&#39;s Purpose by W.

However, he is soon called upon by the Admiralty to take command of the frigate <i>Titan</i> and join the blockade of the French coast. But the <i>Titan</i> will be no easy command with its troubled crew that had launched a successful mutiny against its previous sadistic captain. Once aboard, Clay realises he must confront the dangers of a fractious crew, rife with corrupt officers and disgruntled mutineers, if he is to have a united force capable of navigating the treacherous reefs of Brittany's notorious lee shore and successfully combating the French determined to break out of the blockade.</p><p>Philip K Allan is a British author. He still lives in the UK with his wife and his two teenage daughters. He has an excellent knowledge of the 18th century navy and believes the period has unrivalled potential for a writer. On the one hand there is the strange, claustrophobic wooden world of the period's ships and on the other hand there is the boundless freedom to move those ships around the globe wherever the narrative takes them. All these possibilities are fully exploited in the Alexander Clay novels. Philip's inspiration for the series was to build on the works of novelists like C.S. Forester and in particular Patrick O'Brian. His prose is heavily influenced by O'Brian's immersive style. He too uses meticulously researched period language and authentic nautical detail to draw the reader into a different world. But the Alexander Clay books also bring something fresh to the genre, with a cast of fully formed lower deck characters with their own back histories and plot lines in addition to the officers. Think Downton Abbey on a ship, with the lower deck as the below stairs servants.<b><i>Learn more at philipkallan.com</i></b><i>A Sloop of War</i>&nbsp;is a fast-paced nautical adventure interwoven with land and sea actions, as well as civilian, political, and historical elements. Alexander Clay may be the main character of this book, but Able Sedgwick is a likable fellow who easily takes center stage more than once. His integration into the crew deftly shows life in the Royal Navy, while at the same time demonstrating both acceptance and prejudice among a cast of characters where each is uniquely drawn and rarely stereotypical. The energy in the confrontation between Windham and Clay feels like being shocked by static electricity. Several scenes are laced with humor, and the wonderfully descriptive comparison in the final engagement perfectly allows readers to imagine what is unfolding. Fans of nautical and naval fiction will enjoy this second entry in the series and will look forward to the next phase in Alexander Clay's career and love life.<b>Cindy Vallar, Editor &amp; Reviewer&nbsp;</b></p><h2>Darker Masques</h2><p>A spinetingling and terrifying collection of short horror tales by authors such as Ray Bradbury, Graham Masterson, Dan Simmons, and F.

The traditional view, which presents Islam as a self-consciously distinct religion tied to the life and revelations of the prophet Muhammad in western Arabia, has since the 1970s been challenged by historians engaged in critical study of the Muslim sources. In Muhammad and the Believers, the eminent historian Fred Donner offers a lucid and original vision of how Islam first evolved. He argues that the origins of Islam lie in what we may call the "Believers' movement" begun by the prophet Muhammad&#x20ac;&#x201d;a movement of religious reform emphasizing strict monotheism and righteous behavior in conformity with God's revealed law. The Believers' movement thus included righteous Christians and Jews in its early years, because like the Qur'anic Believers, Christians and Jews were monotheists and agreed to live righteously in obedience to their revealed law. The conviction that Muslims constitu</p><p>Fred M.

No other book I know of distills the often highly arcane and dispersed stuff of scholarship on the first century of Islamic history into such an accessible narrative account that, in addition, offers a compelling new interpretation on the formation of Islamic confessional identity. A tremendous achievement. (Ahmet Karamustafa, Washington University in St. Louis)<br><br>This is an invaluable book. Not only does it provide a sane and lucid guide to the origins of Islam, a topic that is currently more mired in controversy than any other in the entire field of ancient history, but it is also a stimulating and original work of scholarship in its own right. (Tom Holland, author of <i>Millennium</i>)<br><br>Donner presents the intriguing view that the early Islamic movement, as presided over by Muhammad, actively included Jews and Christians in the flock as part of a general monotheistic community. It was only later, after Muhammad's death, that a new generation of Muslims began ritualizing Islam with its own distinctive practices, such as the hajj (pilgrimage) and the five daily prayers...He raises many original points, gleaning evidence from everything from coinage to original source documents. Questioning longstanding stereotypes, he argues (and proves) that Muslims are not, by nature, anti-Jewish and also that, based on archeological evidence, Muslims did not routinely tear down churches. The early Muslims, though brutal in war, created a sophisticated and organized civil system. For those curious about Islam's beginnings, no book is as original and as evenhanded as this succinct read.

What quickly becomes clear is that Islam, and what it means to be a "Muslim," have both changed dramatically since the early days...<i>Muhammad and the Believers</i> is full...of intriguing questions and challenges readers to reconsider what they think they know about Islam...[It's] a rewarding read.

Millions more experienced the Century of Progress International Exposition through newspaper and magazine articles, newsreels, and souvenirs. Together, all marveled at the industrial, scientific, consumer, and cultural displays, many of which were housed in fifty massive and colorful exhibition halls, the largest architectural project realized in the United States during the Great Depression. </p><p>In the richly illustrated <i>Building a Century of Progress,</i> Lisa D. Schrenk explores the pivotal role of the 1933 Chicago World&#x2019;s Fair in modern American architecture. She recounts how the exposition&#x2019;s architectural commission promoted a broad definition of modern architecture, not relying on purely aesthetic characteristics but instead focusing on new design solutions. The fair&#x2019;s pavilions incorporated recently introduced building materials such as masonite and gypsum board; structural innovations (for example, the first thin-shell concrete roof and the first suspended roof structures built in the United States); and new construction processes, most notably the use of prefabrication. They also featured curiosities like the giant, constantly operating mayonnaise maker and the glass-walled House of Tomorrow, which had no operable windows. Schrenk shows how the halls&#x2019; designs reflected cultural and political developments of the period, including the expanding relationships between science, industry, and government; the rise of a corporate consumer culture; and the impact of the Great Depression. </p><p>Many of the designs provoked intense responses from critics and other prominent architects, including Frank Lloyd Wright and Ralph Adams Cram, fueling heated debates over the appropriate direction for architecture in the United States. Demonstrating the rich diversity of progressive American building design seen at the fair, <i>Building a Century of Progress</i> captures a crucial moment in American modernism.</p><p>Lisa D. Schrenk is assistant professor of architecture and art history at Norwich University and former education director of the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio Foundation.</p></p><p>The organizers of the Century of Progress International Exposition chose as their motto Science Finds&#x2014;Industry Applies&#x2014;Man Conforms. With the Great Depression at its worst, they wanted to offer the country a vision of modernity where science and industry worked together to improve every aspect of daily life. They built three million square feet of exhibition space in pavilions that stretched along three miles of landfill on Chicago's southern lakefront. During the exposition's two seasons, 38 million fairgoers watched the manufacture of everything from cars to tin cans, visited model homes with all the latest conveniences (one had a small airplane hanger), and saw ethnographic displays from around the world. Schrenk, an assistant professor of architecture at Norwich University, provides a good discussion of the debates on modern architecture that surrounded the design of the fair. But as her focus shifts to the innovative materials and building methods that went into producing the exposition, chapters on gypsum board, Masonite, glass bricks and thin-shell concrete roofs can be slow going for general readers.

The amazing success of his thirty-eight-year metropolitan ministry in the city of London during the 1800s was said to have been unparalleled in England since the days of Whitefield and Wesley.<br><br>Spurgeon credited his success to the powerful work of the Holy Spirit. He firmly believed that the spiritual transformations that occurred throughout the book of Acts were only the beginning of the mighty works the Holy Spirit intends to do. Declaring that Pentecost was not the pinnacle of the church's experience but only the first unveiling of what could and should happen, Spurgeon called upon believers to receive and live up to the full potential of the Holy Spirit.<br><br>Life-changing messages await you. Spurgeon's teaching is so solidly biblical, so understandable, so passionate, so wonderfully visual, and so practical that one cannot help but be inspired and challenged.</p><p></p><h2>The Gathering Storm (Crown of Stars, Vol. 5)</h2><p><p><b>Set in an alternate Europe where bloody conflicts rage, the fifth book of the Crown of Stars epic fantasy series continues the world-shaking conflict for the survival of humanity</b><br><br>The long-dreaded cataclysm is about to descend on the world as the lost land of the Aoi returns to the Earth from which it was cast forth millennia ago. And though Liath has at last found her way back to Earth, she knows disaster will soon follow her. Yet just how little time remains to avert humanity&#x2019;s destruction she discovers to her horror only when she learns that her brief stay in the bespelled land has actually kept her from her family and allies for nearly four years. <br><br> In that time, Sanglant has mobilized an army and journeyed to the land of the griffins, intent on forging an alliance to stand against the forces which are determined to rework the spell that originally exiled the Aoi and their lands from the world. <br><br> Alain, caught up by Liath as she makes her way back to her own world and time, has been returned to the present bereft of all that matters to him. And though for a while he finds refuge in a monastery, he is soon condemned to a terrible fate. His only hope of rescue lies with the Eika leader Stronghand, who has begun a campaign of conquest into the human lands. <br><br> And even as these diverse forces struggle to avert total ruin, the mathematici, led by Anne and Hugh, strive to re-create the original spell which exiled the ancient Aoi, neither knowing nor caring that their magical workings could tear their world apart....<br><br></p></p><p><b>Kate Elliott</b>&#x2019;s credits include the Nebula finalist novel, <i>King&#x2019;s Dragon</i>, its sequels, <i>Prince of Dogs, The Burning Stone, Child of Flame,</i> and <i>The Gathering Storm</i>; her groundbreaking DAW science fiction series, <i>The Novels of Jaran</i>&#x2014;<i>Jaran, An Earthly Crown, His Conquering Sword, </i>and <i>The Law of Becoming</i>; and her magnificent fantasy collaboration with Melanie Rawn and Jennifer Roberson, <i>The Golden Key</i>.

Within days he has dismissed several members of staff, including the redoubtable laundress Agatha, and is making life so unpleasant for the scholars that even Matthew Bartholomew believes his future as physician and teacher at the college is untenable. But Matthew has many patients to divert his attention and Brother Michael, Proctor of the fledgling university, has some suspicious deaths to investigate, although they cannot help but notice that the new Master has commissioned a flurry of building work. Then Runham himself is murdered and, although mourned by none, Matthew and Michael know they have to solve the mystery before any more damage is done to their beloved Michaelhouse.</p><p>Skillfully blending history, medicine, and murder most foul, these intricate medieval mysteries follow the investigations of 14th&#x2013;century Cambridge physician and forensic sleuth Matthew Bartholomew.

His work has been exhibited internationally, and he is perhaps best known for his feature-length film <i>Imagining Indians</i>. For Masayesva, photography is a discipline that he approaches in a manner similar to the way that he was taught about himself and his clan identity. As he navigates his personal associations with Hopi subject matter in varied investigations of biology, ecology, humanity, history, planetary energy, places remembered, and musings on things broken and whole, he has created an extraordinary visual cosmography. In this compilation of his photographic journey, Masayesva presents some of the most important and vibrant images of that visual quest and reflects on them in provocative essays.</p><p>Author and photographer Victor Masayesva, Jr. is widely recognized as an independent Hopi film producer and director who is at the forefront of experimental work in the Native American film and video community.

Focusing on a country often forgotten in Holocaust histories, this comprehensive account describes how 110,000 Jews were deported from the Netherlands to concentration camps in 1940 but less than 6,000 returned at the end of the war. Utilizing 15 years of research and documents from the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation, the incremental demands on Jewish citizens are analyzed&#x2014;starting with forced registry and ending with death at concentration camps&#x2014;while demonstrating how this slow progression led the Germans involved to accept these atrocities. Graphically recounting stories of persecution, going into hiding, and life in the transit camps, it conveys the despair experienced as families and lives were destroyed, while&nbsp;showing how these stories fit into a wider, global picture.

Today millions of students, parents, and teachers use the Khan Academy's free videos and software, which have expanded to encompass nearly every conceivable subject; and Academy techniques are being employed with exciting results in a growing number of classrooms around the globe.<br><br>Like many innovators, Khan rethinks existing assumptions and imagines what education could be if freed from them. And his core idea-liberating teachers from lecturing and state-mandated calendars and opening up class time for truly human interaction-has become his life's passion. Schools seek his advice about connecting to students in a digital age, and people of all ages and backgrounds flock to the site to utilize this fresh approach to learning.<br><br>In THE ONE WORLD SCHOOLHOUSE, Khan presents his radical vision for the future of education, as well as his own remarkable story, for the first time. In these pages, you will discover, among other things:<br><br> <ul> <li> How both students and teachers are being bound by a broken top-down model invented in Prussia two centuries ago </li><li> Why technology will make classrooms more human and teachers more important </li><li> How and why we can afford to pay educators the same as other professionals </li><li> How we can bring creativity and true human interactivity back to learning </li><li> Why we should be very optimistic about the future of learning.</li></ul>Parents and politicians routinely bemoan the state of our education system. Statistics suggest we've fallen behind the rest of the world in literacy, math, and sciences. With a shrewd reading of history, Khan explains how this crisis presented itself, and why a return to "mastery learning," abandoned in the twentieth century and ingeniously revived by tools like the Khan Academy, could offer the best opportunity to level the playing field, and to give all of our children a world-class education now.<br><br>More than just a solution, THE ONE WORLD SCHOOLHOUSE serves as a call for free, universal, global education, and an explanation of how Khan's simple yet revolutionary thinking can help achieve this inspiring goal.</p><p>Salman Khan was born and raised in Metairie, Louisiana, to immigrant parents from India and Bangladesh. Before founding the Khan Academy, he was a hedge fund analyst. He&#39;s also worked in venture capital and engineering at Oracle and several Silicon Valley start-ups. Khan holds an MBA from Harvard Business School, where he was president of his class, and three degrees from MIT."Since its founding in 2006, Sal Khan's project-the Khan academy-has revolutionized our thinking on the potential and promise of unfettered, open-access online education. In his new book The One World Schoolhouse, Khan presents his vision and blueprint for how online technology can, and should, play an integral role in educating communities across the globe, closing the opportunity gap and providing high-quality education for all."&#x2015;<b><i>Al Gore</i></b><br><br>"In this book, Salman Khan sheds light on how our current education system leaves a gap in every student's core knowledge. He found ways to fill this gap by encouraging differentness, fresh thinking and implementing creativity in the learning process. I strongly believe that all human beings have unlimited creative power. The role of education is to unleash that power. The way he relates the proper goal of education and the natural bent of the child is fascinating. He refers "natural bent" as the particular mix of talents and perspectives that makes each mind unique, and allows minds to be strikingly original. The way Khan portrays the concept of education and the mechanism of learning is revolutionary. This book is a must-read for those providing real education to our children in this new age of technology."&#x2015;<b><i>Muhammed Yunus, the founder of Grameen Bank, and the 2006 recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize</i></b><br><br>"Sal Khan's passion and innovation is transforming learning for millions of students worldwide. The One World School is a must-read for all who are committed to improving education so students everywhere can gain the skills and knowledge to be successful in school, careers and life."&#x2015;<b><i>George Lucas, Filmmaker and Founder of The George Lucas Educational Foundation, publisher of Edutopia</i></b><br><br>"I discovered Sal Khan and Khan Academy like most other people - by using these incredible tools with my own kids. Sal Khan's vision and energy for how technology could fundamentally transform education is contagious. He's a true pioneer in integrating technology and learning. I'm happy that, through this book, even more people will be introduced to this ground-breaking innovator."&#x2015;<b><i>Bill Gates, co-founder &amp; Chairman, Microsoft</i></b><br><br>"The world dreams of education reform, and Sal Khan is delivering.

Brandeis </i>(&#x201c;Remarkable&#x201d;&#x2014;Anthony Lewis, <i>The New York Review of Books;</i> &#x201c;Monumental&#x201d;&#x2014;Alan M. Dershowitz, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i>), <i>Division and Discord,</i> and <i>Supreme Decisions</i>&#x2014;Melvin Urofsky&#x2019;s major new book looks at the role of dissent in the Supreme Court and the meaning of the Constitution through the greatest and longest lasting public-policy debate in the country&#x2019;s history, among members of the Supreme Court, between the Court and the other branches of government, and between the Court and the people of the United States.<br> &nbsp;<br> Urofsky writes of the necessity of constitutional dialogue as one of the ways in which we as a people reinvent and reinvigorate our democratic society. In <i>Dissent and the Supreme Court, </i>he explores the great dissents throughout the Court&#x2019;s 225-year history. He discusses in detail the role the Supreme Court has played in helping to define what the Constitution means, how the Court&#x2019;s majority opinions have not always been right, and how the dissenters, by positing alternative interpretations, have initiated a critical dialogue about what a particular decision should mean. This dialogue is sometimes resolved quickly; other times it may take decades before the Court adjusts its position. Louis Brandeis&#x2019;s dissenting opinion about wiretapping became the position of the Court four decades after it was written. The Court took six decades to adopt the dissenting opinion of the first Justice John Harlan in <i>Plessy v. Ferguson </i>(1896)&#x2014;that segregation on the basis of race violated the Constitution&#x2014;in <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> (1954).<br> &nbsp;<br> Urofsky shows that the practice of dissent grew slowly but steadily and that in the nineteenth century dissents became more frequent. In the (in)famous case of <i>Dred Scott v. Sanford</i> (1857), Chief Justice Roger Taney&#x2019;s opinion upheld slavery, declaring that blacks could never be citizens. The justice received intense condemnations from several of his colleagues, but it took a civil war and three constitutional amendments before the dissenting view prevailed and <i>Dred Scott</i> was overturned.<br> &nbsp;<br> Urofsky looks as well at the many aspects of American constitutional life that were affected by the Earl Warren Court&#x2014;free speech, race, judicial appointment, and rights of the accused&#x2014;and shows how few of these decisions were unanimous, and how the dissents in the earlier cases molded the results of later decisions; how with <i>Roe v. Wade</i>&#x2014;the <i>Dred Scott</i> of the modern era&#x2014;dissent fashioned subsequent decisions, and how, in the Court, a dialogue that began with the dissents in <i>Roe</i> has shaped every decision since.<br> &nbsp;<br> Urofsky writes of the rise of conservatism and discusses how the resulting appointments of more conservative jurists to the bench put the last of the Warren liberals&#x2014;William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall&#x2014;in increasingly beleaguered positions, and in the minority. He discusses the present age of incivility, in which reasoned dialogue seems less and less possible. Yet within the Marble Palace, the members of the Supreme Court continue to hear arguments, vote, and draft majority opinions, while the minority continues to &#x201c;respectfully dissent.&#x201d; The Framers understood that if a constitution doesn&#x2019;t grow and adapt, it atrophies and dies, and if it does, so does the democratic society it has supported. Dissent&#x2014;on the Court and off, Urofsky argues&#x2014;has been a crucial ingredient in keeping the Constitution alive and must continue to be so.<br><br>(With black-and-white illustrations throughout.)</p><p><b>MELVIN I.

According to Rabbi Yehuda, &#x201c;An individual opinion is cited along with the majority opinion as it may be needed at some time in the future.&#x201d;&nbsp;</i>&#x2014;<i>Talmud, Mishna Eduyot 1.5</i><br> &nbsp;<br> When John G. Roberts Jr. testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee at his confirmation hearings in 2005, he indicated that he hoped the Court would return to its older practice of speaking with one voice&#x2014;unanimous opinions founded on narrow grounds. Nearly everyone familiar with the Court and its history&#x2014;scholars and practitioners alike&#x2014;surely smiled at Roberts&#x2019;s seeming na�vet�, and his dream evaporated almost as soon as he took the oath as chief justice. While there have been a few terms in which the Court spoke in one voice almost half the time, there have been others when the nonunanimous rate has exceeded 70 percent.<br> &nbsp;<br> The role of dissent is a long and honored one not only in the history of the Court but in that of the United States as well. Many of the early settlers were either religious or political dissenters, and the colonies soon filled with immigrants holding a wide diversity of views on almost everything. The American Revolution came about because of popular dissension from the policies of His Majesty&#x2019;s Government, and once the colonies had achieved independence, they fell to squabbling among themselves. The Constitution imposed an order on the country that has worked remarkably well for more than 225 years, yet the Framers never intended to quash dissenting views. The First Amendment to the Constitution holds that &#x201c;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&#x201d; And the Framers included a process to amend the document when necessary.<br> &nbsp;<br> The English statesman William Gladstone described the American Constitution as &#x201c;the most wonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose of man.&#x201d; The Framers&#x2014;those &#x201c;demigods,&#x201d; as Thomas Jefferson hailed them&#x2014;intended their work to serve the needs not only of a small nation of thirteen states clinging to the Atlantic Seaboard but of whatever that country might become. While there are some very specific clauses&#x2014;members of the House of Representatives must be twenty-five years old, the term of a senator is six years&#x2014;the great enabling clauses are far more general. What exactly do the following mean?<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x2014;Congress shall have the power to lay and collect taxes, or to regulate interstate and foreign commerce, or</i><br> <i>&#x2014;the executive power shall be vested in a president, or the judicial power in one supreme court, and such other courts as Congress shall establish, or</i><br> <i>&#x2014;no state shall deny its citizens &#x201c;due process of law&#x201d; or &#x201c;equal protection of the laws&#x201d; or impose &#x201c;cruel and unusual&#x201d; punishment.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> Contrary to the arguments of the so-called originalists that the meaning of the Constitution is and always will be the same, the historical evidence is clear that the Framers envisioned the meaning of certain phrases to change as the country grew and evolved, or, as James Madison put it, the meaning of the constitutional text should be &#x201c;liquidated and ascertained&#x201d; over time in the light of the emerging needs of a changing nation. Madison and Alexander Hamilton might not have used the phrase &#x201c;living Constitution,&#x201d; but their essays in The Federalist show that they never intended the document to be static and frozen in the year 1787.<br> &nbsp;<br> Ever since John Marshall handed down the Court&#x2019;s opinion in Marbury v. Madison (1803), it has been &#x201c;emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.&#x201d; Or, as another chief justice said over a century later, &#x201c;the Constitution is what the Supreme Court says it is.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Because the powers of the Supreme Court&#x2014;and indeed of the government itself&#x2014;were still plastic in those days, Marshall sought to have the Court speak in one, authoritative voice and abandoned the English practice of all the judges delivering individual opinions seriatim. This did not sit well with some people, but it did help to build up the type of national government that the Framers had envisioned. Even in Marshall&#x2019;s day, however, there were dissents from the opinion of the Court. Nearly all of them are forgotten today, because they had no lasting jurisprudential value, they did not convince future courts, and, to use the terminology of this book, they did not contribute to the constitutional dialogue.<br> &nbsp;<br> The constitutional dialogue is the device by which our nation has adapted its foundational document to meet the needs of a country that has expanded across the continent, and indeed across oceans, now counts more than 300 million souls, and has become both urbanized and industrialized. It has allowed us to take into account developments that the founding generation could never have envisioned&#x2014;railroads, automobiles, airplanes, telephones, computers, and international relations involving not a few powers in Europe but nearly two hundred nation-states around the world. The United States began as a country in which slavery existed in nearly all of the former colonies; it took a civil war to end that bondage and what some have termed a &#x201c;second reconstruction&#x201d; to erode the legacy of racial segregation. Women and other minorities have won a rightful place in society, and the federal system of shared sovereignty between the states and the federal government is still alive and well.<br> &nbsp;<br> Questions about these developments have come before Congress, the executive branch, and the courts. The answers have never been simple, because political, social, economic, cultural, and legal questions have been involved. All three branches of the federal government, as well as those of the fifty states and the American people, have been involved in debates ranging from the rights enjoyed by corporations to campaign finance laws to same-sex marriage. Starting almost from the founding, this debate has been continuous, lively, and, as I hope to show, essential to our nation&#x2019;s well-being.<br> &nbsp;<br> Each generation of Americans has debated public policy in a variety of ways, and a majority of the questions asked have had no simple answers. If we look back at American history, hardly any major policy decision since the founding has not had advocates on two or more sides of the issue. That has made ours a vibrant democracy, but the debate has also taken place within the parameters of constitutional provisions&#x2014;both those that empower certain options and others that limit them. While I refer to this debate among other branches of the government and the people, my main focus is on the debate within the Supreme Court.<br> &nbsp;<br> In 1835, a French visitor to the United States, Alexis de Tocqueville, noted that &#x201c;scarcely any political question arises in the United States that is not resolved, sooner or later, into a judicial question.&#x201d; Where other societies have sometimes taken to the streets to resolve important questions of government, in the United States we go to court both for private law matters, such as contract or tort issues, and for public law. It is one of the great strengths of our system, and it places a great deal of power in the hands of the nine men and women who sit in the Marble Palace in Washington.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have always told my students that only the hardest cases get to the Supreme Court; if the issue is easy, it is resolved in the lower courts. Because the questions are hard, and because they cause disagreement among the people, it is not surprising that the justices of the high court will also disagree. But all of them understand that just because a majority decided that &#x201c;A&#x201d; is right in a particular case, it does not mean it will always be the law. The dissenter will point out what he or she perceives to be the weakness of the majority opinion, the faulty constitutional reasoning, or a failure to understand the actual facts of the case. If the dissent is strong enough, if it is well reasoned, it may persuade other judges in the future to overturn the majority decision and accept the minority view.<br> &nbsp;<br> This does not happen often. Many cases, even if not unanimous, are decided correctly, and the dissent will be little noted nor long remembered. That is as it should be. While we expect the high court to take into account differing views, we also want it to resolve the case at hand correctly. But some issues are not easily determined, and that is where the dissent comes in. The dissenter is telling the majority, &#x201c;Wait. I think you have this wrong. You need to look at that constitutional clause and its history again. You need to ask other questions.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Sometimes the separate opinion has an immediate impact. A draft dissent may win over sufficient votes to become the majority view. At other times, it may lead the majority to accept some of its points, and thus modify the holding. More important, the dissent tells lower courts and future justices that this rule needs to be examined carefully, and it should eventually be revised or overturned.<br> &nbsp;<br> Louis Brandeis often said that his faith in time was great. He believed&#x2014;rightly as it turned out&#x2014;that many of the dissents he wrote in his twenty-three years on the bench would eventually prevail. His separate opinion in Whitney v. California (1927)&#x2014;a concurrence that is in fact a dissent&#x2014;is considered by many scholars to be the greatest dissent ever written, ultimately shaping our modern jurisprudence of free speech. It did that because in cases in the four decades following Whitney the Court had to take into account Brandeis&#x2019;s views. Even though Brandeis died in 1941, his opinion kept speaking to the Court, his ideas an essential part of the constitutional dialogue over the meaning and purpose of free expression in a democratic society.<br> &nbsp;<br> This book traces dissenting opinion across American constitutional history. It is not, however, a history of dissent, and given the thousands of dissents that have been written, it would be impossible to deal with all of them. My concern has been those dissents that have played a critical role in the dialogue, and even there I am sure people will say, &#x201c;What about this dissent? Isn&#x2019;t it important?&#x201d; It may well be, but it would be impractical to deal with the entire dialogue. My purpose is to illustrate the dialogue, show how and why it is important, and look at representative justices and cases.<br> &nbsp;<br> The dialogue that shaped constitutional understanding has also formed us as a nation. The constitutional dialogue does not take place in a vacuum, and in developing our understanding of the Constitution, it also molds us as a people. When the justices talk about the limits of free speech, for example, their decisions and the dissenting opinions create and most often expand how &#x201c;We the People&#x201d; can discuss and make our policy decisions. When the Court deals with difficult cases involving discrimination, it reflects the fissures in the broader society over how minorities will be treated and often not only serves to increase the rights of those groups but affects the public dialogue on those matters.<br> &nbsp;<br> The dialogue that takes place among the justices is a reflection of a far larger dialogue taking place among the citizenry. We are still trying to answer the question asked many years ago by the Framers, &#x201c;What kind of country shall we be?&#x201d; So when the discussion in the chapters that follow talks about economic or civil liberties, or the contours of criminal justice procedure, or how enemy combatants should be treated, that discussion always, even if not at all times overtly, is tracking not only the constitutional dialogue taking place within the Court but the broader conversation between the Court and the other branches of government and between the justices and the people. These are not one-way monologues, and even if not every decision of the Court and its accompanying dissents lead to an overwhelming public reaction, the process is there. That is, I would suggest, the most important feature of the constitutional dialogue&#x2014;the way it shapes not only the Constitution but our society.</p><h2>The Forgetting: Alzheimer&#39;s: Portrait of an Epidemic</h2><p><br>An urgent and moving exploration of the Alzheimer&#x2019;s epidemic, <b>The Forgetting</b> is a dazzling meditation on the nature of memory and self and on the disease that robs people of both. <br><br>Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease is a demographic time bomb. Since 1975, the number of Americans afflicted has risen from five hundred thousand to five million; over the next fifty years, an estimated eighty to <i>one hundred million</i> more people worldwide will succumb to it. But it is the story behind these numbers that makes <b>The Forgetting</b> such a landmark work. A magnificent synthesis of history, science, politics, psychology ,and profound human drama, the book explores the nature of a disease that attacks not merely memory but the very core of our human identity.<br><br>Delving into such diverse areas as art history, literature, genetics, and neurobiology, David Shenk shows that Alzheimer&#x2019;s particular terror, the gradual eradication of memory and of mind is as old as humankind itself. He convincingly posits that such historical figures as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Jonathan Swift and Frederick Law Olmstead were caught in the disease&#x2019;s insidious grip. Moving portraits of contemporary patients, their families, and their caregivers drive home the sad pattern of regression Alzheimer&#x2019;s exacts, a pathology that eerily mirrors child development in reverse. Yet Shenk offers a well of empathy and understanding for families striving to better understand and come to terms with their loss.<br><br>With equal mastery Shenk charts the complicated race to find a cure. As scientists pursue a treatment worth billions of dollars, the brutal competition among them poses a serious threat to the traditional ethic of sharing vital research. But there <i>are</i> heartening signs of progress, and for the first time there is excitement among scientists that a cure may indeed be possible.<br><br>Shenk eloquently calls Alzheimer&#x2019;s &#x201c;death by a thousand subtractions.&#x201d; <b>The Forgetting</b> is at once a powerful examination of what this means and a forthright discussion of the impact this epidemic will have on the life of every reader.</p><p>First attracted to his subject by its horrific ability to destroy the human mind and body, journalist David Shenk ultimately finds reasons to accept Alzheimer's disease--and almost forgive it--in <i>The Forgetting</i>. Shenk describes his work as a biography, the life story of a biological outlaw that sends victims "on a slow but certain trajectory toward forgetting and death." But his illuminating portrait of this growing epidemic offers more than a basic chronology. Shenk begins with the disease's christening in 1906, when German physician Alois Alzheimer discovered mysterious tangles and plaques in the brain of a dead woman who in life had suffered severe memory loss and dementia. The tale unfolds to reveal a host of intriguing players: struggling scientists (the clever, the bullheaded, and the pharmaceutically endowed), politicians divided by opposing priorities, exhausted caregivers, and patients whose biological clocks virtually tick backward over an average eight-year period. It includes impossible twists: longer life expectancies and successful treatments for other diseases mean more cases of Alzheimer's will inevitably occur. Shenk's graceful synthesis of personal accounts (from Plato to Reagan) with a century-long search for answers and cures leads him to an impressive conclusion. Perhaps Alzheimer's disease is much like winter: "Once it is gone, we'll face less hardship, but we'll also have lost an important lens on life." <i>--Liane Thomas</i>&#x201c;Riveting . . .

Whether a character is seeking the solace of a poem or avoiding the emotional weight of a song, each one learns in some way the power that words and art have over (and even beyond) life. This power sometimes feels familiar to us, such as when a character in &#x201c;The Cold Flame&#x201d; returns as a ghost to make sure his poems get published, and sometimes takes a more uncanny turn, more magic and danger than your everyday reverence for a novel or a painting. But in every case, this supernatural treatment of the arts gives the stories a strangely pre-modern tone, a mode of writing that became increasingly unpopular in literature in the post-war days Aiken wrote in. And yet it is this sincere belief in the signs and symbols humans create for ourselves that make Aiken&#x2019;s stories feel timeless and moving, that allow them to come to life in our current historical moment."<br>&#x2015; Emily Nordling, Tor.com<br><br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re looking for speculative short fiction of a decided literary bent, it&#x2019;s hard to imagine a more satisfying source than this assembly of fantastical work by the peerless, prolific Joan Aiken (who died in 2004), assembled from across her storied career. The magical and the everyday collide in these short, evocative tales, which, in marvelously efficient, elegant prose, find unsettling strangeness lurking just around the corner from normal (the ghost of a puppy is trapped in an abandoned storage box, fairy queen squat in overgrown forests). A slim, seriously moving collection.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015; Joel Cunningham, B&amp;N SF&amp;F<br><br>&#x201c;A welcome anthology of fantasy stories by a 20th-century master. The author of the beloved classic gothic for children <em>The Wolves of Willoughby Chase,</em> Aiken (1924-2004) also wrote hundreds of works of popular fiction that spanned the genres, from fantasy to horror to historical fiction, including several Jane Austen sequels. Naturally the tone of her books and short stories varies with their content, but its main notes include sophisticated, spritely satire and the darker moods of literary fairy tales. Fans of Wolves will recognize the honorable orphans and cruel guardians who populate these tales.

Whether a character is seeking the solace of a poem or avoiding the emotional weight of a song, each one learns in some way the power that words and art have over (and even beyond) life. This power sometimes feels familiar to us, such as when a character in The Cold Flame&#x201d; returns as a ghost to make sure his poems get published, and sometimes takes a more uncanny turn, more magic and danger than your everyday reverence for a novel or a painting. But in every case, this supernatural treatment of the arts gives the stories a strangely pre-modern tone, a mode of writing that became increasingly unpopular in literature in the post-war days Aiken wrote in.

The magical and the everyday collide in these short, evocative tales, which, in marvelously efficient, elegant prose, find unsettling strangeness lurking just around the corner from normal (the ghost of a puppy is trapped in an abandoned storage box, fairy queen squat in overgrown forests).

His many other books include the epic fantasies Oath of Swords and The War God&#39;s Own (also Baen).Here comes Honor Harrington again, and her entire crew of fans will man the yards to cheer. In her fifth adventure, she is trying to overcome self-doubts about her competence, grief over her lover's murder (despite having splendidly avenged it), and the barriers to a woman's being an effective feudal ruler on the fiercely patriarchal planet of Grayson. She is making headway when a Havenite fleet shows up, bent on the destruction of Grayson, and she must go back into space as an admiral while her enemies resort to open treachery and murder in trying to bring her down. Honor triumphs again, but with a believable amount of difficulty; she is growing into one of the more complex protagonists in military sf. Meanwhile, her fandom will continue to fall in love with Nimitz, the empathic treecat, and admire Weber's sheer ingenuity in so many aspects of creating Honor's universe. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>The Paper Bag Princess 25th Anniversary Edition</h2><p>The book was an instant success and has since sold millions of copies in dozens of languages all over the world.

To others, an irritant. To the army colonel, Charlie, with his crumpled suits and leaking shoes, is the final inherited embarrassment from a disgraced department he is committed to revitalise. Who better, then, to sacrifice in the capture of a KGB general who is masterminding the Soviet Union&#39;s European spy net from behind the counter of his London wine importers business? So upon one man settle the hopes of East and West. All Charlie hopes to do is survive. On his own terms, of course.</p><p><p>Brian Freemantle [b. 1936] is one of Britain's most acclaimed authors of spy fiction. His novels have sold over ten million copies worldwide. Born in Southampton, Freemantle entered his career as a journalist, and began writing espionage thrillers in the late 1960s. Charlie M (1977) introduced the world to Charlie Muffin and won Freemantle international recognition&#x2014;he would go on to publish fourteen titles in the series.&nbsp;<br><br>Freemantle has written dozens of other novels, including two featuring Sebastian Holmes, an illegitimate son of Sherlock Holmes, and the Cowley and Danilov series, about an American FBI agent and a Russian militia detective who work together to comabt organized crime in the post-Cold War world. Freemantle lives and works in London, England.</p>Charlie Muffin, an endearing spy, irritates his new boss and co-workers because of his appearance and age, but that doesn't stop them from taking the credit for his accomplishments. But Charlie perseveres and proves to be right over and over again in this story of the capture of a KGB general who is running a spy network in England. Hayward Morse ably creates voices for each of the many characters, using a variety of convincing accents, though once in a while he doesn't shift to the correct voice. He is especially effective in his timing and makes the humor of certain situations evident. Through all the plot twists, there is never any hint of the surprising outcome. S.S.R. � AudioFile 2003, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>William Pitt the Younger : A Biography</h2><p>A lively, authoritative biography of one of the towering figures in British history who became Prime Minister at the age of twenty-four, written by the youngest-ever leader of the Tory Party. The younger William Pitt -- known as the &#39;schoolboy&#39; -- began his days as Prime Minister in 1783 deeply underestimated and completely beleaguered. Yet he annihilated his opponents in the General Election the following year and dominated the governing of Britain for twenty-two years [nearly nineteen of them as Prime Minister]. No British politician since then has exercised such supremacy for so long. Pitt presided over dramatic changes in the country&#39;s finances and trade, brought about the union with Ireland, and directed [and was ultimately consumed by] the years of debilitating war with France. Domestic crises included unrest in Ireland, deep division in the royal family and the madness of the King, and a full-scale naval mutiny. He enjoyed huge success, yet died at the nadir of his fortunes, struggling to maintain a government beset by a thin majority at home and military disaster abroad; he worked, worried and drank himself to death. William Hague&#39;s biography is comparable to Roy Jenkins&#39;s recent bestselling life of Churchill -- an eminent politician writing an outstanding Prime Ministerial life -- and announces the arrival of a brilliant new historical writer.</p><p>William Hague was born in Rotherham in 1961. While at Oxford, he was President of the Union and of the University Conservative Association.He has been MP for Richmond, Yorkshire since 1989. He joined the Cabinet in 1995 as Secretary of State for Wales, and was leader of the Conservative Party from June 1997 to June 2001. This is his first book.Chapter One<br>Elder and Younger<br><br>It would scarcely be possible to imagine a more intensely political family than the one into which William Pitt was born on 28 May 1759. On his father's side, his great-grandfather, grandfather and uncle had all been members of Parliament. His father, twenty-five years an MP, was now the leading Minister of the land. On his mother's side, that of the Grenville family, one uncle was in the House of Lords, and two others were in the Commons, one of them to be First Lord of the Treasury by the time the infant William was four years old. An understanding of Pitt's extraordinary political precocity requires us to appreciate the unusual circumstances of a family so wholeheartedly committed to political life.<br><br>It was in the year of William's birth that the career of his father, still also plain William Pitt, approached its zenith. Three years into what would later be known as the Seven Years' War, in which Britain stood as the only substantial ally of Prussia against the combined forces of France, Austria, Russia, Saxony and Sweden, the elder Pitt had become the effective Commander-in-Chief under King George II of the British prosecution of the war. In his view the war had arisen from "a total subversion of the system of Europe, and more especially from the most pernicious extension of the influence of France." He was not nominally the head of the government, the position of First Lord of the Treasury being held by his old rival the Duke of Newcastle, but he was the senior Minister in the House of Commons. Through his powerful oratory he dominated both Parliament and the Ministry, and was acknowledged as the effective leader of the administration. As Newcastle himself said in October of that year: "No one will have a majority at present against Mr. Pitt. No man will, in the present conjuncture, set his face against Mr. Pitt in the H. of Commons."<br><br> From taking office at the age of forty-eight in 1756 as Secretary of State for the Southern Department,* with a brief interruption of two months during the cabinet crisis of 1757, Pitt had become the principal source of ministerial energy in both organising for war and in preparing a strategy for Britain to do well out of it. It was Pitt who gave detailed instructions on the raising and disposition of the troops and the navy, and Pitt who insisted on and executed the objective of destroying the empire of France. As the French envoy, Fran�ois de Bussy, was to complain to the leading French Minister, the Duc de Choiseul, after meeting Pitt in 1761: "This Minister is, as you know, the idol of the people, who regard him as the sole author of their success . . . He is very eloquent, specious, wheedling, and with all the chicanery of an experienced lawyer. He is courageous to the point of rashness, he supports his ideas in an impassioned fashion and with an invincible determination, seeking to subjugate all the world by the tyranny of his opinions, Pitt seems to have no other ambition than to elevate Britain to the highest point of glory and to abase France to the lowest degree of humiliation . . ."<br><br>It was in 1759 that Pitt, previously dismissed as a rather unpredictable politician with a distinctly chequered career, came to be regarded as the saviour of the nation. His insistence on fighting a European war with offensives elsewhere-in America, the Caribbean, Africa and on the oceans of the world-was crowned with success within months of the birth of his second son, William. Instead of having to face the French invasion feared throughout much of the year, Britain celebrated a stream of military successes that summer and autumn: victory at Minden in Germany in August, the storming of Quebec which shattered French rule in Canada in September, the simultaneous news of victories which reinforced British dominance of India, and then the defeat and scattering of the French fleet at Quiberon Bay in November. These events brought about a change in the public perception of the elder Pitt, analogous to the regard in which Churchill was held after 1940 compared to the controversy which previously surrounded him. From then on there was a sense of reverence, sometimes of awe, towards him, both on parliamentary occasions and among the wider public. Tall, haughty, but always eloquent, he was the great orator and war leader who had placed himself beyond party gatherings and factions to be at the service of the nation. The young William, as he became conscious of the people and events around him, would know only a world in which his father was treated as a legend.<br><br>Such renown was a far cry from the frustrated ambitions of earlier generations of Pitts. Being a younger son, the elder Pitt had enjoyed little in the way of financial inheritance, but his ancestors and relatives had been well connected and often very wealthy for the previous century and a half. Pitt's forebears had included prominent and sometimes wealthy officials under Elizabeth I and James I, but it is Thomas Pitt of Bocconoc (1653-1726) who brings the family story to life. He was the buccaneering "Diamond Pitt" who went to India and made a fortune in probably illegal competition with the East India Company, came back and purchased English property with it, including the medieval borough of Old Sarum,* and then returned to India on behalf of the Company as Governor of Madras. While there, he bought a 130-carat diamond for �25,000 which he hoped to sell to one of the European royal families for at least ten times as much. Returning to Britain during the War of the Spanish Succession (1702-1713), he discovered that European royalty was otherwise preoccupied, but eventually sold the diamond at a substantial but much smaller than expected profit to the Regent of France. With this and other earnings from his exploits in India, Thomas Pitt set about buying more estates, particularly in Cornwall. He was part of a new and often resented breed of rich men who came back from the East to buy property and parliamentary influence at home. He used his wealth to help all five of his children on their way in life, particularly the eldest son, another Thomas Pitt, who kept most of the family wealth and became Earl of Londonderry. A younger son, Robert Pitt, was put into Parliament for Old Sarum in 1705, for which he sometimes sat alongside his father. Robert Pitt was undistinguished, came close to disaster by being on the fringes of Jacobite attempts to overthrow the new Hanoverian dynasty, and died young, but not before fathering six children, the fifth of whom was William Pitt, the future Earl of Chatham. Once again the eldest son was a Thomas Pitt, who after much litigation and family dispute ended up with the lion's share of the family wealth.<br><br>The family lived at Stratford-sub-Castle near Salisbury, but at the age of ten William was sent with his eldest brother, Thomas, to Eton, an experience which proved decisive in his later determination to educate all of his own children at home. He remarked much later to the Earl of Shelburne that he "scarce observed a boy who was not cowed for life at Eton; that a publick school might suit a boy of a turbulent forward disposition, but would not do where there was any gentleness."<br><br>It seems that Robert Pitt had intended William for the Church, but William himself had other ideas, joining the army at the lowest officer rank in the cavalry, as a Cornet of Dragoons. He never saw active service, since the long-serving Whig Minister Robert Walpole did an effective job of keeping Britain out of various international disputes at the time, but he took the opportunity to travel to the Continent on a modest version of the Grand Tour through France, Switzerland and Holland. This was the only time he left his native country; an eighteenth-century political career did not require extensive travel. Like his son, he was later to dispose of huge forces, alliances and treaties around the globe, while only once in his life leaving the shores of Britain. He was clearly determined to continue the emerging Pitt tradition of serving in Parliament, and was duly elected for the family borough of Old Sarum in the general election of 1734, but only after some acrimony when his brother Thomas suggested giving the seat to the sitting member, with financial compensation for William instead.<br><br>Although Pitt seems to have been well disposed towards Walpole and the Whigs at the time he was elected, he soon fell in with key figures in the opposition, notably Lord Cobham, his ex-Colonel, and Prince Frederick, the Prince of Wales. The relationship between Prince Frederick and his father, King George II, was an early example of a noted Hanoverian tradition, being one of unmitigated hatred between monarch and heir. The Prince of Wales was truly loathed by both his father and mother. Queen Caroline once exclaimed when she saw the Prince pass her dressing-room window: "Look, there he goes-that wretch! that villain!-I wish the ground would open this moment and sink the monster to the lowest hole in hell!" Such loathing was exacerbated when the King's adoption of a Hanoverian mistress became public knowledge, so helping to make the Prince the more popular member of the Royal Family. Pitt, as a young MP and army officer, became part of the Prince's circle, with some of his early parliamentary speeches being unmistakably toadying towards the Prince. He became a regular opponent of Walpole, and was dismissed from his position in the army as a result.<br><br>A study of the rise to power of the elder Pitt over the subsequent twenty years provides four main conclusions which assist in appreciating the career of his son. First, elections in the eighteenth century were not contested by organised political parties with a programme or manifesto. Although in the mid-eighteenth century many politicians could still be roughly categorised as Whig or Tory, even this distinction was breaking down. The opposit...</p><h2>Cobb: A Biography</h2><p>A biography of the baseball legend explores the complexities of a man described as the meanest man in baseball, discussing Cobb&#39;s racism, violence toward family and other baseball players, win at any cost philosophy, and philandering</p><p>Not long before his death, Ty Cobb, as complex and haunted a human being as ever stepped onto a diamond, tapped a young writer named Al Stump to collaborate with him on his autobiography. The result, <i>My Life in Baseball: The True Record</i>, never came close to reaching first base; with Cobb (holder of the game's highest lifetime batting average and lowest lifetime reputation) calling the signals, it was an antiseptic whitewash, as false as its titular claim would have you believe otherwise. Hidden between the lines was the living hell that Cobb--reclusive, bitter, ravaged with cancer, in great pain, and shunned by the baseball community--put Stump through to make sure his demon-filled story was properly sanitized.<p> Some 30 years later, Stump brilliantly wrought his revenge with the best tool a writer can wield: absolute honesty. In <i>Cobb</i>, he rectifies his earlier cover-up and paints an unforgettable portrait of an unforgettable character: The Georgia Peach--pits and all. Not only does Stump painstakingly assemble the disparate pieces of Cobb's tangled personality and storied career, he also recounts in scrupulous detail the literal wild ride that comprised his months in the company of the dying baseball legend. It is, from its opening inscription ("To get along with me," Cobb told Stump, "don't increase my tension"), a tour de force, as good a sports biography as exists, and an altogether riveting telling of a riveting life. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>Al Stump (1916-1995) was born in Colorado Springs, Colorado. During World War II, he was a war correspondent, and afterward he worked as a sportswriter for national and regional publications, including <i>Esquire</i>, <i>The Saturday Evening Post</i>, <i>True Magazine</i>, <i>American Heritage</i>, <i>Los Angeles Magazine</i>, and <i>Sports Illustrated</i>. He wrote&#x2014;both independently and in collaboration with famous athletes&#x2014;six books, including Ty Cobb's <i>My Life in Baseball</i>, Sam Snead's <i>Education of a Golfer</i>, <i>Champions Against Odds</i>, and <i>The Champion Breed</i>.

She unearths a secret that will not only shatter the entire political landscape of New York, but expose Alexandra to the darkest, most dangerous, and most profoundly disturbing revelation of her career.<br><br>Watch a Video</p><p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Linda Fairstein was chief of the Sex Crimes Unit of the district attorney&#x2019;s office in Manhattan for more than two decades and is America&#x2019;s foremost legal expert on sexual assault and domestic violence. Her Alexandra Cooper novels are international bestsellers and have been translated into more than a dozen languages. She lives with her husband in Manhattan and on Martha&#x2019;s Vineyard.</p>One<p>&#x201c;How many bodies?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Six, Ms. Cooper. So far we got six dead. But there&#x2019;s a mean rip and a swift current out there. Anybody&#x2019;s guess what&#x2019;s going to wash up by the end of the day.&#x201d;</p><p>I was walking toward the ocean behind a cop sent to escort me from my car, following him on the path that had been formed in the dunes by the first responders who had tracked across it two hours earlier, at daybreak.</p><p>&#x201c;One woman?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; The cop cupped his hand to his ear as he turned to look at me. The gust of wind that blew a clump of damp sand against the side of my face also carried off my words.</p><p>&#x201c;The news is reporting that one of the victims is a young woman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We got two now. Girls, really. Teenagers at best. Four men and two girls.&#x201d;</p><p>I stopped at the crest of the dune and scanned the horizon. Dozens of police officers were scattered along a quarter mile of beach, their blue uniforms a deeper color than the rough Atlantic. Detectives in windbreakers and all-weather jackets looked slightly less </p><p>incongruous in this unlikely setting, some scouring the shoreline while others gathered around the survivors who had been brought to land.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it,&#x201d; the cop said, pointing at the rusted freighter that was grounded on a sandbar about three hundred yards out to sea, listing to port, as police launches and Coast Guard boats darted around it. &#x201c;<i>Golden Voyage</i>. That&#x2019;s the name of the ship they sailed on.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Golden Voyage </i> my ass,&#x201d; Mike Chapman said, coming up beside me, adjusting his sunglasses as he spoke. &#x201c;It must have been the crossing from hell. Happy New Year, Coop.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Same to you, Mike. Although this doesn&#x2019;t get it off to a particularly pleasant start.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I got her from here, pal,&#x201d; Mike said, dismissing the cop. &#x201c;You warm enough?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. Battaglia called me at home this morning,&#x201d; I said, referring to my boss, the district attorney of New York County. &#x201c;Did you just arrive?&#x201d;</p><p>We were both dressed in jeans. I had a cashmere sweater under my ski jacket, with gloves and a scarf to protect myself against the brisk January day. Mike wore a white turtleneck beneath his trademark navy blazer. The winter cold never bothered him, any more than the sight of a corpse.</p><p>&#x201c;Nope. Human trafficking&#x2014;you don&#x2019;t get worse scumbags than the guys who deal in flesh. All the squads got called in right away. Every borough,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I was doing a midnight so I shot out here from a crack den in Harlem. Just went back to the car now to get my shades. The glare on the water&#x2019;s a killer.&#x201d;</p><p>Mike was one of the best detectives in the city, assigned to Manhattan North Homicide, which handled every case from Fifty-ninth Street to the northern tip of the island. We&#x2019;d been professional partners&#x2014;and close friends&#x2014;for more than a decade.</p><p>&#x201c;Where do you want to start?&#x201d; he asked me. People were swarming across the beach like armies of insects. &#x201c;The tent over there to the left on that paved area&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the temporary morgue.</p><p></p><p>The group in the middle, we&#x2019;ve got more than a hundred victims off the wreck so far, trying to get them in dry clothes. The commissioner is due in by chopper any minute now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s in charge?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Feebies, kid. The feds are running the operation. Your buddy from the task force, Donovan Baynes. His group is trying to set up a command center on the right. Hardest thing,&#x201d; Mike said, starting down the slope, &#x201c;is holding the press at bay. Roping them off on the street is easy, but keeping the helicopters and power boats away is more of a problem, now that news has spread. C&#x2019;mon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Take me to Baynes, okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Battaglia doesn&#x2019;t let go, I&#x2019;ll give him that. Rockaway Beach&#x2014;the Irish Riviera&#x2014;this is Queens, for Chrissake. That parking lot where the morgue is, it&#x2019;s over the line in Nassau County. What makes him think he has jurisdiction here?&#x201d; Mike&#x2019;s loafers made a crunching sound as they pounded the sand while we toured the scene. His straight black hair, gleaming in the sunlight, was blowing wildly as he walked into the wind.</p><p>&#x201c;Global and mobile. That&#x2019;s how he likes to think of himself. He&#x2019;s been DA for so long he doesn&#x2019;t believe there&#x2019;s anything that limits him,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why he fought so hard to get me on the task force.&#x201d;</p><p>Human trafficking, a modern-day form of slavery, wasn&#x2019;t even on the books until federal laws addressing it were enacted in 2000. Before that, prosecutors had patched together local legislation to attempt to punish the handful of individuals who could be linked to efforts to transport victims across borders, coercing them to work at everything from agricultural labor to child prostitution.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning, Counselor,&#x201d; a detective greeted me as we approached the group of men encircling Donovan Baynes. &#x201c;Chapman, how many interpreters did you call for?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A boatload. Why? How many you got so far?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Two. Only two have showed up.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What language?&#x201d; I asked, trying to process the sight of scores </p><p>of dazed victims who were wrapped in blankets, staring out at the shipwreck, undoubtedly looking for family members and friends.</p><p>&#x201c;Ukrainian,&#x201d; Mike said. &#x201c;Why? You ever do a Ukrainian, kid? A little pillow talk and your Ukrainian could be almost as good as your French.&#x201d;</p><p>I had just returned from Paris two days earlier&#x2014;on Monday&#x2014;where I spent the New Year holiday with my lover, Luc Rouget. The more about my personal life I kept from Mike, the more he needled me. &#x201c;No surprise. Since the Soviet collapse, Ukraine leads Eastern Europe in the number of trafficking victims.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you want me to do about it, Chapman?&#x201d; the detective asked. &#x201c;We got to move these guys off the beach before they freeze their balls off. Sorry, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nobody&#x2019;s gonna freeze today. It&#x2019;s almost fifty degrees,&#x201d; Mike said, not breaking his stride. &#x201c;Send some cars over to Little Odessa. Go to a few coffee shops and grab anybody who&#x2019;s sitting still.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Brighton Beach. Right next door, in Brooklyn. You&#x2019;re like Coop&#x2014;you need a road map to the Outer Boroughs.&#x201d;</p><p>Brighton had been built as a local beach resort in the 1860s, named for the English coastal town in a contest held by its developers. In the 1970s, it was nicknamed Little Odessa because of the large concentration of immigrants from that Black Sea city, once one of the great ports of Imperial Russia.</p><p>Donovan Baynes waved as he saw us approaching. I&#x2019;d known the forty-one-year-old since his days as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of the U.S. Attorney&#x2019;s Office. He was surrounded by four men, three of them agents I recognized from our task force meetings. &#x201c;Hurry up, Alex. Glad you&#x2019;re here. I think you know everybody.&#x201d;</p><p>I shook hands and introduced myself to the unfamiliar man. He appeared to be in his early fifties, barefoot and dressed in a wetsuit that was sculpted to his well-muscled body. &#x201c;Hi, I&#x2019;m Alexandra Cooper. Manhattan District Attorney&#x2019;s Office.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stu Carella. Used to be homicide, NYPD. Guess you don&#x2019;t remember me, but we met at a few crime scenes when I was still on the job. The dancer at the Met, the broad who was kidnapped at Fort Tilden,&#x201d; he said, then nodded at Mike. &#x201c;I see she&#x2019;s still stalking you, Chapman.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My order of protection expired, Stu. I asked the judge to keep her three hundred feet away and to tell her to stop stealing my underwear, but she&#x2019;s out of control again. Be careful, man, Coop&#x2019;s a sucker for guys in tights.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Let me bring you up to speed, Alex,&#x201d; Baynes said, ignoring Mike&#x2019;s chatter as he put his arm around my shoulder. He&#x2019;d been around the two of us enough to know this was standard operating procedure for Mike. Behind us were the high-rise buildings of the Rockaways&#x2014;mostly nursing homes at this end&#x2014;and the smaller residences that bordered the beach. &#x201c;About five of the vics have been debriefed. The ship left Sevastopol more than a month ago, with close to three hundred people on board, mainly men, but at least thirty women and children.&#x201d;</p><p>I looked out at the decrepit cargo ship, amazed that it had made it here from Europe.</p><p>&#x201c;Smugglers find the villagers living the most desperate lives, promise them jobs and a better life in America. Take every nickel they&#x2019;ve managed to save, claiming to use it to feed them on the trip. Bribe officials. You know all that. They trucked these folks from small towns all over their country and loaded them into sweltering holds on board the ship, then began dodging immigration police throughout the Mediterranean.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They got all this way only to run aground here and die within sight of land,&#x201d; I said. The stories I&#x2019;d heard from trafficking victims were heartbreaking, but at least those who were rescued by law enforcement agencies often had a second chance.</p><p>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t an accident,&#x201d; Baynes continued, turning to his deputy. &#x201c;The leader of the operation in New York&#x2014;well, what do you call a snakehead in Ukrainian?&#x201d;</p><p></p><p>&#x201c;A friggin&#x2019; snakehead, Donny,&#x201d; Mike said. &#x201c;You brainiacs got to go to law school to figure that out? It&#x2019;s the same in any language.&#x201d;</p><p>Ages ago, the Chinese perfected the ugly practice of smuggling human beings, called snakes, for slave labor. Ringleaders of the inhumane syndicates had long been known as snakeheads.</p><p>&#x201c;The boss of the operation is somewhere in this city. When the captain got close to shore just after midnight, he radioed his contact, who was supposed to send a small fleet of speedboats out to pick up the passengers,&#x201d; Baynes went on. &#x201c;Two, three hours went by and no sign of escorts. Apparently, the anxiety level of the immigrants who&#x2019;d been pigeonholed for weeks went over the top. The first handful of men had been brought up on deck to be unloaded, and one of them got frantic when he saw a vessel with government markings coming toward them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Coast Guard?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;We haven&#x2019;t gotten that far, Alex. No agency we know of has claimed yet that they tried to intercept the ship.&#x201d;</p><p>Mike picked up the story. &#x201c;That first group just went berserk and staged a mutiny, according to two of the guys who made it ashore. They locked the captain in his cabin with a few of the other managers. Some of the men were in such despair about being caught by immigration that they started jumping overboard to swim in.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That water must be frigid,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Frigid? Don&#x2019;t go showing off your area of expertise, Coop. That&#x2019;s why we hauled Stu out of retirement.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like I was just telling Donovan,&#x201d; Carella said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in the Polar Bear Club here at Coney Island. We swim every Sunday, all winter long. Just had our big New Year&#x2019;s party five days ago. Not so bad for the Atlantic. Forty-three degrees. Some hypothermia, maybe. Everybody will be watching out for that today. Cold water doesn&#x2019;t have to be fatal, Alex.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But at least six people have died.&#x201d;</p><p>Carella shook his head. &#x201c;Probably drowned.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Drowned? The ship is so close to shore. The water isn&#x2019;t even that deep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Panic kills, Coop. Everybody who works on water knows that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Panic?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Can you believe it? Not all the peasants in Europe grew up with a pool in the backyard like you did, princess.&#x201d;</p><p>Shouts went up from the crowd of victims and several of them broke through a line of cops, running almost thirty yards eastward to the water&#x2019;s edge. Stu Carella dashed after the frantic young men and passed beyond them as he dove into the surf, where something that looked like a large rag doll was lifted again and flopped around by a tall wave that kept licking at the sand. He and three cops in scuba gear grabbed and carried another body onto the beach. One of the men immediately crouched in an effort to resuscitate the limp corpse.</p><p>I started after them and Donovan Baynes pulled me back. &#x201c;Let it be, Alex. They know what they&#x2019;re doing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How many do you think jumped ship?&#x201d; I wanted to make myself useful, but all the specialized squads of the NYPD were well-trained for this kind of disaster.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s impossible to get an accurate count at this point. One fellow they&#x2019;ve talked to explained that when the mutineers began to struggle with the captain, he tried to steer the damn thing away from shore, back out into the open sea. Making that turn, he ran the ship aground on a shallow sandbar. Some of the victims figured they were so close to the beach they could reach land&#x2014;even several who didn&#x2019;t know how to swim. Maybe twenty jumped. Maybe forty. Nobody seems to know yet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The men you&#x2019;ve talked to, do they know where they thought they were going?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Nobody told them the truth, Alex. It&#x2019;s the usual scam,&#x201d; Donovan said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been there&#x2014;people who don&#x2019;t see a future for themselves and want to believe in a dream, but wake up in the middle of a nightmare. Countrymen were supposed to meet them right here in Queens and bring them into their homes until they&#x2019;re placed in jobs&#x2014;mostly agricultural ones&#x2014;in farms upstate and in the Midwest. Those would be the men, the lucky ones.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The young women would become your territory,&#x201d; Mike said.</p><p>I had seen this time after time in my role as chief sex crimes prosecutor in the DA&#x2019;s office&#x2014;girls abducted from their homes in Thailand or Montenegro, running away from abusive parents and desolate lives in Sri Lanka or Serbia, smuggled across borders in car trunks or leaky boats, often following their brothers or schoolmates, hoping that hard work and physical labor would eventually gain them the freedom of a new life in the States.</p><p>But the girls rarely made it to farmlands and fields. The sex trade had become a huge transnational industry, as lucrative as it could be deadly. The teenagers on the Golden Voyage were doubtless bound for basements and brothels, to be broken in by their owners for the months and years of prostitution that awaited them in the promised land.</p><p>&#x201c;Is there any way to identify these victims?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No better than usual. Each one is supposed to have a piece of paper with his or her family name and town of origin in their pockets when they ship out,&#x201d; Baynes said. &#x201c;Most of them tossed or swallowed the paper as the police launches arrived. The brother of one of the dead girls is among the few who are talking. He dove in and she tried to follow.&#x201d;</p><p>A lanky man sat at the corner of the tented morgue, with a gray blanket covering his head and upper body. I couldn&#x2019;t tell whether he was shaking from the cold or because he was crying so hard.</p><p>Stu Carella was making his way back to us, refusing the offer of an NYPD sweatshirt that one of the cops thrust at him.</p><p>&#x201c;Another kid gone,&#x201d; Carella said, throwing a tuft of algae at the ground in disgust. &#x201c;Probably drowned in three feet of water, unable to handle the pull of the rip.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;From his hand?&#x201d; Mike knelt down and picked up the slimy green vegetation with the tip of his pen.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>Mike whistled and the closest cops looked up. He signaled one, who jogged to us. &#x201c;Carry this over to the medical examiner. Goes with that latest body.&#x201d;</p><p>The fact that the victim had been clutching algae, and I&#x2019;d bet a handful of sand, as he was dragged across the ocean floor meant that he had been alive when he went into the water. Drowning, I had learned over the years, was a diagnosis of exclusion. A complete autopsy would be necessary for each of the Golden Voyagers who had wa...</p></p><h2>The Righteous: The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust</h2><p>The Unsung Heroes of the Holocaust<br><br>Drawing from twenty-five years of original research, Sir Martin Gilbert re-creates the remarkable stories of non-Jews who risked their lives to help Jews during the Holocaust<br><br>According to Jewish tradition, "Whoever saves one life, it is as if he saved the entire world." Non-Jews who helped save Jewish lives during World War II are designated Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem, the Holocaust archive in Jerusalem. In <i>The Righteous</i>, distinguished historian Sir Martin Gilbert, through extensive interviews, explores the courage of those who-throughout Germany and in every occupied country from Norway to Greece, from the Atlantic to the Baltic-took incredible risks to help Jews whose fate would have been sealed without them. Indeed, many lost their lives for their efforts.<br><br>Those who hid Jews included priests, nurses, teachers, neighbors and friends, employees and colleagues, soldiers and diplomats, and, above all, ordinary citizens. From Greek Orthodox Princess Alice of Greece, who hid Jews in her home in Athens, to the Ukrainian Uniate Archbishop of Lvov, who hid hundreds of Jews in his churches and monasteries, to Muslims in Bosnia and Albania, many risked, and lost, everything to help their fellow man. <br></p><p>One of Britain's most distinguished historians, Sir Martin Gilbert was knighted in 1995. Among his many books are <i>The Holocaust</i> (0-8050-3848-7), <i>The First World War</i> (0-8050-4734-4), <i>The Second World War</i> (0-8050-1788-7), <i>Churchill: A Life</i> (0-8050-2396-8), and <i>The Boys</i> (0-8050-4403-5).<br>From <i>The Righteous</i>:<br><br>"What were the motives of those who tried to save Jews from deportation and death?" This question is raised with every account of rescue, as the reader, like the historian, wonders whether they would have behaved in such a courageous manner. First and foremost, the Righteous of this book chose to act; theirs was a deliberate decision to behave in a civilized, humane manner, rather than to do nothing, or to refuse to be involved, or to take the route of barbarism.<br><br>In the circumstances of a combination of Nazi rule, SS power and Gestapo terror, inaction motivated by fear cannot be belittled. Those who turned against the tide of terror were all the more remarkable. "We did what we had to do"; "Anyone would have done the same"-the words of many rescuers mask the courageousness of the course they chose, knowing it to be full of danger, often the danger of execution of their families as well as themselves. Yet these were not foolhardy, rash or intemperate people; most of them made their choice calmly, deliberately and with full realization of the risks, risks that they faced, and took, for months and even years.<br></p><h2>Karsh Canadians</h2><p>pp. 203, b/w photographs of prominent Canadians by the iconic Yousef Karsh.�&nbsp;�&nbsp;'...79 portraits of Canadian is a tribute to the men and women Karsh has encountered in his travels across the land, and a 'thank you' to his adoptive country.�&nbsp; It is also a portrait of the entire span of Yousuf Karsh's distinguished career at...</p><p></p><h2>Ancient Celtic Coin Art</h2><p>Little bigger than a fingernail, Celtic Coins are one of the richest sources of Celtic art in the world, and yet few people are even aware that they exist.

She is delighted with her new acquaintances: flirtatious Isabella, who shares Catherine&#39;s love of Gothic romance and horror, and sophisticated Henry and Eleanor Tilney, who invite her to their father&#39;s mysterious house, Northanger Abbey. There, her imagination influenced by novels of sensation and intrigue, Catherine imagines terrible crimes committed by General Tilney. With its broad comedy and irrepressible heroine, this is the most youthful and and optimistic of Jane Austen&#39;s works. The Penguin English Library - 100 editions of the best fiction in English, from the eighteenth century and the very first novels to the beginning of the First World War.</p><p>Though <i>Northanger Abbey</i> is one of Jane Austen's earliest novels, it was not published until after her death--well after she'd established her reputation with works such as <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, <i>Emma</i>, and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>. Of all her novels, this one is the most explicitly literary in that it is primarily concerned with books and with readers. In it, Austen skewers the novelistic excesses of her day made popular in such 18th-century Gothic potboilers as Ann Radcliffe's <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i>. Decrepit castles, locked rooms, mysterious chests, cryptic notes, and tyrannical fathers all figure into <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, but with a decidedly satirical twist. Consider Austen's introduction of her heroine: we are told on the very first page that "no one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy, would have supposed her born to be an heroine." The author goes on to explain that Miss Morland's father is a clergyman with "a considerable independence, besides two good livings--and he was not in the least addicted to locking up his daughters." Furthermore, her mother does <i>not</i> die giving birth to her, and Catherine herself, far from engaging in "the more heroic enjoyments of infancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a canary-bird, or watering a rose-bush" vastly prefers playing cricket with her brothers to any girlish pastimes. <p> Catherine grows up to be a passably pretty girl and is invited to spend a few weeks in Bath with a family friend. While there she meets Henry Tilney and his sister Eleanor, who invite her to visit their family estate, Northanger Abbey. Once there, Austen amuses herself and us as Catherine, a great reader of Gothic romances, allows her imagination to run wild, finding dreadful portents in the most wonderfully prosaic events. But Austen is after something more than mere parody; she uses her rapier wit to mock not only the essential silliness of "horrid" novels, but to expose the even more horrid workings of polite society, for nothing Catherine imagines could possibly rival the hypocrisy she experiences at the hands of her supposed friends. In many respects <i>Northanger Abbey</i> is the most lighthearted of Jane Austen's novels, yet at its core is a serious, unsentimental commentary on love and marriage, 19th-century British style. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>One of the first of Jane Austen&#39;s novels to be written, and one of the last to be published, Northanger Abbey is both an amusing story of how a naive girl enters society and wins the affection of a witty young clergyman, and a high-spirited parody of the lurid Gothic novels that were popular during Austen&#39;s youth. In the process it features a vivid account of social life in late eighteenth-century Bath, and Austen&#39;s famous defence of the novel as a literary form. This edition, based on the text of the novel as published posthumously in 1818, is accompanied by explanatory notes, and an appendix summarising the plots and situations of the Gothic fictions that form the basis of much of Austen&#39;s comedy. In addition there is an extensive critical introduction covering the context, publication, and critical history of the novel, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and authoritative textual apparatus.</p><h2>Return of the Warrior (Brotherhood of the Sword, Book 2)</h2><p><p>Fearless men, their allegiance is to each other, to the oppressed, and to the secret society known as the Brotherhood of the Sword -- and they must never surrender to the passionate yearnings of their noble hearts.</p><p>Fiercely devoted to her people and her land, Queen Adara refuses to let a power-mad usurper steal her crown. But the only way to protect what is hers is to seek out the man she married in childhood.</p><p>A proud, tormented warrior, Christian of Acre owes allegiance only to the mysterious Brotherhood -- and has no wish to be king over anyone but himself. Now a bold and beautiful stranger has appeared in his rooms, tempting him with an irresistible seduction and demanding he accompany her back to their kingdoms ... or, at the very least, provide her with an heir to her throne. Though he cannot abandon the brave regal lady to her enemies, Christian dares not give in to his traitorous body's desires. Yet how can he deny the passion that is rightfully his and the ecstasy that awaits him in Adara's kiss?</p></p><p><p><em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Kinley MacGregor lives a life of extraordinary danger...as does any woman with three sons, a husband, a menagerie of pets, and a collection of swords that all of the above have a major fixation with. But when not running interference (or dashing off to the emergency room), she can be found chained to her computer where she likes to play with all her imaginary friends. With more than ten million copies of her books in print, in 26 countries, she certainly has a lot of friends to play with, too.</p><p>Writing as Kinley MacGregor and Sherrilyn Kenyon, she is the author of several series including: The Dark-Hunters, Brotherhood of the Sword, Lords of Avalon, and BAD. With an international, cult following, her books have appeared in the top three on the<em> New York Times, Publishers Weekly</em>, and <em>USA Today</em> bestseller lists.</p>Plenty of passion can't save this weakly plotted second entry in MacGregor's Brotherhood of the Sword series (after <i>Dark Champion</i>). Queen Adara must find the husband she hasn't seen since they wed as children if she is to save her small kingdom near Byzantium. Unfortunately, Adara's quest reaches an obstacle in Prince Christian himself, who not only has forgotten their marriage but wishes to avoid anything restricting his freedom. Raised in a monastery after the death of his parents and recently released after having spent six years in a squalid prison, Christian wants only to avenge wrongs done to fellow knights who shared his sufferings as a captive of the Saracens. While evidently set during the Crusades, the book has only a perfunctory sense of time and place. The trite, simplistic dialogue ("Fine, Adara. Whenever you decide to grow up and act responsibly, I shall be in our tent") as well as Adara's ability to say good-bye in several anachronistic languages ("<i>Bon voyage. Auf Wiedersehen. Vaarwel. Arrivederci</i>") show that MacGregor, who scored highly with her MacAllister series (<i>Claiming the Highlander</i>, etc.), has really stumbled here. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In <i>Bodies of Inscription</i> Margo DeMello explains how elite tattooists, magazine editors, and leaders of tattoo organizations have downplayed the working-class roots of tattooing in order to make it more palatable for middle-class consumption. She shows how a completely new set of meanings derived primarily from non-Western cultures has been created to give tattoos an exotic, primitive flavor. <br> Community publications, tattoo conventions, articles in popular magazines, and DeMello&#x2019;s numerous interviews illustrate the interplay between class, culture, and history that orchestrated a shift from traditional Americana and biker tattoos to new forms using Celtic, tribal, and Japanese images. DeMello&#x2019;s extensive interviews reveal the divergent yet overlapping communities formed by this class-based, American-style repackaging of the tattoo. After describing how the tattoo has moved from a mark of patriotism or rebellion to a symbol of exploration and status, the author returns to the predominantly middle-class movement that celebrates its skin art as spiritual, poetic, and self-empowering. Recognizing that the term &#x201c;community&#x201d; cannot capture the variations and class conflict that continue to thrive within the larger tattoo culture, DeMello finds in the discourse of tattooed people and their artists a new and particular sense of community and explores the unexpected relationship between this discourse and that of other social movements.<br> This ethnography of tattooing in America makes a substantive contribution to the history of tattooing in addition to relating how communities form around particular traditions and how the traditions themselves change with the introduction of new participants. <i>Bodies of Inscription</i> will have broad appeal and will be enjoyed by readers interested in cultural studies, American studies, sociology, popular culture, and body art.<p></p><p></p></p><p>&#x201c;A fascinating book bursting with penetrating description.

It is the inspiration for art, the subject of science, and the source of some of the greatest stories ever told. In <em>Anatomies</em>, acclaimed author of <em>Periodic Tales</em> Hugh Aldersey-Williams brings his entertaining blend of science, history, and culture to bear on this richest of subjects. <p>In an engaging narrative that ranges from ancient body art to plastic surgery today and from head to toe, Aldersey-Williams explores the corporeal mysteries that make us human: Why are some people left-handed and some blue-eyed? What is the funny bone, anyway? Why do some cultures think of the heart as the seat of our souls and passions, while others place it in the liver?</p><p>A journalist with a knack for telling a story, Aldersey-Williams takes part in a drawing class, attends the dissection of a human body, and visits the doctor&#x2019;s office and the morgue. But Anatomies draws not just on medical science and Aldersey-Williams&#x2019;s reporting. It draws also on the works of philosophers, writers, and artists from throughout history. Aldersey-Williams delves into our shared cultural heritage&#x2015;Shakespeare to <em>Frankenstein</em>, Rembrandt to <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em>&#x2015;to reveal how attitudes toward the human body are as varied as human history, as he explains the origins and legacy of tattooing, shrunken heads, bloodletting, fingerprinting, X-rays, and more.</p><p>From Adam&#x2019;s rib to van Gogh&#x2019;s ear to Einstein&#x2019;s brain, <em>Anatomies</em> is a treasure trove of surprising facts and stories and a wonderful embodiment of what Aristotle wrote more than two millennia ago: &#x201c;The human body is more than the sum of its parts.&#x201d;</p> 16 illustrations</p><p>Hugh Aldersey-Williams is the author of many books, including The Tide, Anatomies, Periodic Tales, and The Most Beautiful Molecule, a finalist for the Los Angeles Times Book Prize.

Do you wrestle with cultural messages that demean the homemaker s calling and exalt instead the emotionally androgynous power-woman---the wife whose worth is measured only by the degree of her self-ambition, the shape of her body, or her money-making skills?<p> Delightfully fresh and honest, <i>Passionate Housewives Desperate for God</i> debunks the modern 'desperate housewife' myth and provides fresh vision for the homemaker. Hear a former Christian feminist share how she went from a die-hard homemaker-in-training to a dedicated career woman, and then back again---after God gripped her heart. See the hollow counterfeit of whitewashed feminism and me-ology destroyed. And consider the beautiful picture painted in Scripture of the truly fulfilled homemaker who glories in the hopeful calling God created for her.</p><p> Pull up a chair, dust off the cookie crumbs, and join Jennie Chancey and Stacy McDonald as they they lay aside demeaning stereotypes like the 'Stepford wife,' and reveal the 1950s' 'perfect homemaker' trap. Laughter and tears will flow, and hopefully you will be infused with a renewed vision for victory as a wife and mother. Discover what it means to be a passionate housewife 'desperate' for God alone!</p></p><p><b>Stacy McDonald</b><br> Stacy is the thankful wife of Pastor James McDonald, the contented mother of ten children, and a soon-to-be first-time grandmother. Mrs. McDonald is also author of the life changing book, <i>Raising Maidens of Virtue: A Study of Feminine Loveliness for Mothers and Daughters</i>. She has been blessed with the opportunity to teach women around the globe on issues relating to the roles of a wife and mother, homeschooling, and Christian decorum. Stacy and her husband, along with their children, reside in Central Illinois and operate Family Reformation ministries, dedicated to the reformation of the Christian family.<p> <b>Jennie Chancey</b> Jennie is the wife of Matthew Chancey and the happy mother of eight children, whom the Chanceys homeschool.

Jennie edits LadiesAgainstFeminism.com, a site which brings together writers from all over the world to expose the damaging effects of feminism and celebrate the beauties of biblical womanhood. She also owns the successful home-based Sense &amp; Sensibility Patterns, begun when she was a newlywed to inspire women to embrace their femininity.</p><i>Passionate Housewives Desperate for God</i> is an exceptionally well written book. Jennie Chancey and Stacy McDonald do not pretend to be the perfect wives, mothers, and homemakers, but they do have a heart for God and His glory. Both of them see the role of the wife and mother as God's high and holy calling, and they exhort us through Scripture and practical examples to, by God's grace, fulfill that calling. This book will make you think, will convict you, and will, as the subtitle states, give you a 'fresh vision for the hopeful homemaker.' I highly recommend this book. --<b>Martha Peace, author of The Excellent Wife</b><br><br>Jennie Chancey and Stacy McDonald have spoken the Truth with a capital 'T' in their wonderful book <i>Passionate Housewives Desperate for God</i>. Totally grounded in Scripture, this book winsomely presents the true picture of a godly homemaker. Prepare to be stimulated, challenged, and encouraged as a woman. This book is a real gem! --<b>Vickie Farris, wife of HSLDA founder, Michael Farris, Esq.</b><br><br>As a mother of eight, I am encouraged to see this book published to help women who desire to walk as passionate servants, who want to 'do the right thing,' and who love the natural yearnings which God created in them. We all have a longing to create, cultivate, and faithfully nurture the gifts God has given us. When the gifts come in the form of family, we would do well to listen to the Biblical wisdom of Stacy and Jennie to counteract the Western culture s strident cry for self-assertion. I gladly recommend this book for all women who want to honor Him and help others (even a two year old!) to glorify Him by dying to self with joy and thanksgiving. He is worthy of our efforts, and these two authors cheer us on to Biblical femininity. --<b>Valerie Shepard, daughter of Elisabeth Elliot</b></p><h2>Vieira Da Silva</h2><p>&#39;The ever-expanding Basic Art Series from Taschen is a winner - glossy colour art books with great reproductions good enough to frame, and intelligent commentary: can&#39;t be beat&#39; The Bookseller, London &#39;Back to visual basics&#39;.

She has written several children&#x2019;s books and her commentary and comics appear in newspapers and magazines around the world, including <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The New Yorker</i>. She is also the author of the internationally best-selling and award-winning comic book autobiography in two parts, <i>Persepolis</i> and <i>Persepolis 2</i>.This slight follow-up to Satrapi's acclaimed <i>Persepolis </i>books explores the lives of Iranian women young and old. The book begins with Satrapi arriving for afternoon tea at her grandmother's house. There, her mother, aunt and their group of friends tell stories about their lives as women, and, more specifically, the men they've lived with and through. One woman tells a story about advising a friend on how to fake her virginity, a scheme that goes comically wrong. Another tells of escaping her life as a teenage bride of an army general. Satrapi's mother tells an anecdote of the author as a child; still others spin yarns of their sometimes glamorous, sometimes difficult, lives in Iran. The tales themselves are entertaining, though the folksiness and common themes of regret and elation feel familiar. Satrapi's artwork does nothing to elevate her source material; her straightforward b&amp;w drawings simply illustrate the stories, rather than elucidating or adding meaning to them. Characters are hard to distinguish from each other, and Satrapi's depictions of gestures and expressions are severely limited, hampering any attempt at emotional resonance. This work, while charming at times, feels like an afterthought compared to Satrapi's more distinguished work on <i>Persepolis </i>and its sequel. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As a convert from Islam, Saleeb has spent many years studying Islam and Christianity. With Dr. Sproul he focuses on four basic areas in which Islam rejects the very foundations on which Christianity is built:</p> <ul> <li>the nature and authority of the Bible</li> <li>the nature of God</li> <li>the character of humankind</li> <li>the deity and sacrificial death of Christ</li> </ul><p>Sproul and Saleeb will help you understand Islam better and give you an intellectual basis for answering the Muslim faith-perhaps when interacting with Muslims in your own neighborhood or city.

He and Bill Lee have also collaborated on <i>Have Glove, Will Travel</i>.1<br>God, it's dark. I am sitting in the lotus position on the floor of the office of Montreal Expo president and general manager John McHale. There is not another soul around. It is early morning, the lights are out, and the room is as quiet as a crypt. That may seem spooky to some, but I find it rather relaxing.<br><br>I had been summoned to these executive chambers for an audience with McHale. I was presuming he was upset with me. Less than twenty-four hours earlier I had walked off the Expos in protest over the release of our second baseman, Rodney Scott. The walkout lasted four hours; I had gone back to the clubhouse before that afternoon's game was over. Upon returning, I was informed by manager Jim Fanning that I had been indefinitely suspended, was about to be fined, and had to see McHale the next day. I assumed that it would be then that the shit would really hit the fan.<br><br>I had stopped off in the clubhouse before going up to McHale's inner sanctum. The only player there was John Milner. Milner was a psychic. Had to be. He had spent most of his career with the Mets, Pirates, and Expos as a lefthand hitting outfielder--first baseman, playing against right-handers or sitting on the bench in a state of advanced readiness. Life as a platooned player breeds an ability to perceive events long before they actually happen. So, on the morning of May 9, 1982, as we both sat in that clubhouse, and he handed me a fried egg sandwich, I'm sure we both knew that he was giving me something more than just an early snack. He was giving the condemned man his final meal. I thanked him, ate it, and made my way to the door, pausing only to grab a bagel. Slobbering it with peanut butter and cream cheese, I thought to myself, What a time for us to run out of spareribs.<br><br>I went directly to McHale's office and, seeing no secretary around, decided to let myself in. I made myself comfortable on his floor and quickly reached a meditative state that was beyond transcendental. This wasn't the first time I had crossed swords with management; I was always matching wits with authority. Pondering over my past and present hassles, I began to wonder why my life had taken the direction it had. What cosmic forces had led me to this precise moment that saw me, once again, dancing on the rim of the volcano? The answers started to come to me as my life flashed before my eyes. I think it all started when I was arrested as a pyromaniac.<br>I was five years old.<br><br>It was a tree that got me into trouble. My grandfather owned a walnut ranch, and he had hundreds of beautiful walnut groves. I loved to sit and look at them. There were similar ranches all around his spread. One of them was cursed with this horrible-looking tree. It was gnarled, twisted, and diseased. I was only five, but even then I had an appreciation for the beauty of nature. I decided the best thing anybody could do for this poor wreck was to put it out of its misery. I grabbed a book of matches and held services for it. I always liked the idea of cremations. Very neat and clean. I had whipped up a pretty good pyre when suddenly the air was filled with the sound of sirens. Somebody had seen the smoke and sent in an alarm. When the fire engines arrived they were able to put out the flames in a couple of minutes. There really wasn't much damage: The tree was hardly marked. I didn't fare as well. A fire marshal collared me and hauled me off to the firehouse. My parents had to come and get me. I really caught it for that one. The tree enjoyed a perfect revenge because for the next two weeks my butt developed a severe inability to come in contact with wood. Or any other hard surfaces.<br>I really didn't get into much trouble when I was a kid. I spent my formative years in California, living first in the San Fernando Valley and then moving to Marin County when my father received a transfer from the telephone company. We had a real Leave It to Beaver sort of family. I was Wally and my younger brother, Paul, was the Beave. There was some sibling rivalry there. As a child he was much prettier than I was, so I took a scissors and cut off all his curly locks. Transformed him into a normal mortal and robbed him of his strange powers. I used to jump in whenever he was involved in a fight. Everyone would turn on me and start swinging. Paul would back off and start rooting for the other kids. I guess he really liked those curls.<br>Looking back, I suppose there were some omens that my destiny had already been laid out. When I was seven years old I had to go to First Holy Communion practice, and it really made me nuts. It was so boring! I mean, all you really had to be able to do was kneel down and open your mouth. How much practice does that take? We would do it every day for hours. I just couldn't take it. It had become the Catholic version of the Chinese water torture. One day I took my Roy Rogers handcuffs and locked myself to my bedpost. Those were really good cuffs--this was 1955, in the pre-Taiwan era of toys--and they had a key, which I had carefully hidden. It took my mother hours to get me unshackled. I spent the whole time watching television and missing out on Sister Merry Christmas's inspirational chidings. This was an immediate tip-off on how resourceful I could be. I was too small to overpower anybody, so I outsmarted them. It was the sort of thing that would later help me compensate for the lack of a good fastball.<br>The Lees were an athletic family. I grew to six feet three inches, getting my size from my mom. Dad was an average height but had amazing reflexes. He had played a lot of sandlot ball and fast-pitch softball. He was a teammate of Don Drysdale's father, Scotty. Don was their bat boy. They used to play their games in Canoga Park, which is situated right near the orange groves where Jack Nicholson almost got his ass blown off in Chinatown. I used to jog through there with my friends, and the farmers would fire rock salt at us. I never got hit. Even as a kid I had good lateral movement.<br>My grandfather William F. Lee, Sr., was one of the top infielders in Los Angeles in the early 1900s. He used to get fifty dollars a game to play. That was a lot of money back then, and he didn't have an agent. The Lees always did their own negotiating. Still do. He probably could have been in the majors, but he had a family to support and he knew that there was neither money nor security in playing baseball, so he pursued it only on weekends.<br>He must have been a real scrapper. Grandfather used to cut the leather out of the center of his glove and just leave his bare palm, in order to make the double play quicker. He said modern ballplayers were pussies because they wore those big gloves; he claimed it robbed them of their manual dexterity. The Japanese have gone back to the small glove, knowing my grandfather was right. They're not afraid to combine modern technology with age-old traditions. That's why we're all driving Toyotas.<br>When my grandfather played gloves were scarce. When you came off the field you usually left your mitt at your position, allowing a member of the opposing team to use it. The other side's shortstop would come out and have to wear this little glove with the middle cut out of it. He could not handle it. He would end up making a lot of errors with the same glove my grandfather was using to turn all those double plays. Bill, Sr., wasn't unaware of the advantage this gave him. In telling me about it, he always made sure that I understood the very valuable baseball lesson he was trying to teach me: Always look for an edge.<br>My brother, Paul, was a better athlete than I, very quick, but he severed his Achilles tendon while playing football against West Texas State and separated his shoulder in another ball game. Paul got carried off the football field so often that by the time the baseball season started, he looked like a pile of raw hamburger. These and other injuries he received on the playing field forced him to look away from sports as an occupational avenue.<br>The best athlete in the family--and I mean the best baseball player in the family, including me--was my Aunt Annabelle Lee. She was called Lefty and was one of the biggest influences on my life. She threw harder than I did, even when I was in high school, and could really bring it. My aunt pitched the first perfect game in the history of the Women's Semi-Pro Hardball League in Chicago and had a lifetime ERA of 1.17. That was her idea of the Equal Rights Amendment. Any man who did not consider her an equal could try hitting against her. Annabelle was a Pete Rose--type player, sliding head first and playing with a burning intensity. She wouldn't give an inch on the field to anyone, man or woman. I like to think I got my competitive nature from her.<br>When I was eight years old, my brother and I were playing near the highway close to home when a bum came over and tried to grab him. He wrestled free, and we jumped over a fence into some orange groves and started pelting the bum with oranges. I nailed him in a vulnerable spot. Right in the flask, breaking it into a hundred pieces. That's when I knew I was born to be a pitcher.<br>I got my first taste of organized ball in Little League. My father was the coach. He really hadn't encouraged me to become a ballplayer. He felt that a person had the right to develop his own interests without the bias of parental supervision influencing his choice. This somewhat modern approach to parenting caused him to wait until my mother was three months' pregnant with me before he bought me my first fielder's glove.<br>Actually, both of my parents encouraged my brother and me to pursue whatever interests we had. They were great. My father was an excellent coach, very good at imparting baseball fundamentals. He used to crowd the entire team into a '50 Chevy and drive us out to the park for practice. That's a great way of learning the team concept. You really get to know your teammates when you're crammed into a car with about a dozen of them.<br>My father taught us all to hustle, and he made his pitchers throw strikes. He hated walks. We lost two games in four years and went ...</p><h2>Noel Coward: A Biography</h2><p>Offers a look at the professional and personal life of the noted playwright</p><p>Noel Coward was a remarkably prolific writer with dozens of plays, several films, hundreds of songs plus volumes of autobiographies, stories and verse to his credit, produced in his rapid-fire style from the 1920s through the 1960s.

Almost immediately after the discovery of LSD less than a hundred years ago, psychedelics began to play a crucial role in the quest to understand the link between mind and matter. With an uncanny ability to reveal the mind&#x2019;s remote frontiers and the unmapped areas of human consciousness, LSD and MDMA (better known as Ecstasy) have proven extraordinarily effective in treating anxiety disorders such as PTSD&#x2014;yet the drugs remain illegal for millions of people who might benefit from them.<br><br>Anchoring Tom Shroder&#x2019;s <i>Acid Test </i>are the stories of Rick Doblin, the founder and executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), who has been fighting government prohibition of psychedelics for more than thirty years; Michael Mithoefer, a former emergency room physician, now a psychiatrist at the forefront of psychedelic therapy research; and his patient Nicholas Blackston, a former Marine who has suffered unfathomable mental anguish from the effects of brutal combat experiences in Iraq. All three men are passionate, relatable people; each flawed, each resilient, and each eccentric, yet very familiar and very human.<br><br><i>Acid Test </i>covers the first heady years of experimentation in the fifties and sixties, through the backlash of the seventies and eighties, when the drug subculture exploded and uncontrolled use of street psychedelics led to a PR nightmare that created the drug stereotypes of the present day. Meticulously researched and astoundingly informative, this is at once a personal story of intertwining lives against an epic backdrop, and a compelling argument for the unprecedented healing properties of drugs that have for decades been characterized as dangerous, illicit substances.</p><p>TOM SHRODER is an award-winning journalist, editor, and author of <i>Old Souls</i>, a classic study of the intersection between mysticism and science. As editor of <i>The Washington Post Magazine</i>, he conceived and edited two Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning feature stories. His most recent editing project, <i>Top Secret America: The Rise of the New American Security State</i>, by Dana Priest and William Arkin, was a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller.Foreword<p>In 1975 I was a twenty-one-year-old college journalist, home on spring break in Sarasota, Florida, when I noticed a blurb in the local news- paper about a charismatic hippie with a pet wolf who was building himself a spectacular house in the woods near town. I decided to go out and see it for myself. I don&#x2019;t remember anything about the blurb. I doubt it mentioned anything about the inf luence of psychedelic drugs in this project. But I am guessing that I inferred it, because while I didn&#x2019;t much care about techniques of home building&#x2014;nor would my college-student readers&#x2014;I was extremely interested in the implications of the psychedelic experience.</p><p>I&#x2019;m looking at a taped-together, Xeroxed copy of the story that resulted from that visit. Still no mention of drugs, but there it is between the lines. I wrote about the philosophy of the young builder, a guy named Rick Doblin, just a year older than me. It was about try- ing to live authentically, guided by an inner light rather than society&#x2019;s preconceived ideas; consciously working to discover and create his own destiny rather than trudging along the rutted tracks set before him.</p><p>These were the kinds of notions floating around a certain subculture in those days; it was evident in the woodland home itself, with its giant, rainbow-themed, spiritually suggestive stained-glass window. Maybe we discussed psychedelics, maybe we didn't. But they were in the air.</p><p>I myself was not entirely unfamiliar. Under the influence of the psilocybin mushrooms my friends and I had learned to pluck from cow dung in the rural fields not far from campus, then boil into tea and drink, I had seen the world-and myself-from a novel vantage point.</p><p>It was like being able, for a few precious hours, to climb above your life</p><p>and view it from on high, a perspective every bit as revealing as seeing a too-familiar landscape from the top of a mountain. Instead of indi� vidual cornstalks or oak trees or buildings, you saw checkerboard pat� terns of fields, serpentine forests following the course of a river, villages arrayed around ascending spires of churches. You saw, for once, how it all fit together.</p><p>One experience stands out in my memory, because it is something that I have carried with me, every day since, for four decades. <i>As </i>the drug took effect, instead of feeling the usual lift, I grew increasingly entangled by anxiety. I began to obsess about an ethical problem I was struggling with, which generalized to feelings of inadequacy in life overall and my inability to find solutions.</p><p>The more I struggled against these feelings, the weightier and more intractable they seemed. And then s uddenly I had a vision: I saw myself with my arms wrapped around a boulder. I could feel its weight, almost unbearable to hold, and yet I was clinging to it. I knew that the heavy stone consisted of all my doubt s and anxieties, and as I desperately clutched it to my chest, I saw in a flash that part of me <i>chose </i>to be anxious-as a way to avoid making choices and evade responsibility for them. To be free of that awful weight, all I had to do was open my arms, which I did. The stone simply dropped away.</p><p>Ever since, although it has rarely been easy, I've been able to see negative emotions, on a profound level, as a choice, and the will to let them go as something I could develop, like a muscle. The more I prac�ticed, the better I got, and I no longer needed the mushrooms to do it.</p><p>There wasn't a moment I decided to stop doing psychedelic drugs. When I left the college environment they became less available, and I gained more responsibilities-a job, a family, a professional reputation� all of which made any illegal activity, and the potential health risks, unacceptable. But I never lost my interest in those psychedelic experi� ences, or forgot their profundity, and the lasting good they did me.</p><p>Ten years after graduation, I had become an editor at the <i>Miami Herald </i>Sunday magazine, <i>Tropic, </i>when I noticed a story in the Tampa newspaper about a perennial college student who was promoting the party drug Ecstasy as a breakthrough in psychotherapy. I did a double take: it was Rick Doblin, the hippie with the house in the woods, the same guy I had written about a decade earlier. I assigned a <i>Herald </i>fea� ture writer to do a cover story on him. We headlined it: ''A Timothy Leary for the '80s."</p><p>Twenty years passed. Now I was editor of <i>The Washington Post Magazine, </i>and once again an article that spoke to my lingering interest in the possible positive effects of psychedelics caught my eye. This time it was in the <i>New York Times, </i>about Harvard initiating a study testing the use of MDMA- Ecstasy- to treat anxiety and depression inter� minal cancer patients. The man sponsoring the study: a very sophisticated-sounding Harvard Kennedy School PhD named Rick <i>Doblin- the hippie in the woods.</i></p><p>I got a phone number and Rick answered. When I told him my name, he laughed. He not only remembered me and the two stories from twenty and thirty years earlier, he still had copies of them both. And just that morning, he told me, he'd held up the "Tim Leary" cover of <i>Tropic </i>at a board meeting of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), his nonprofit organization, to demon� strate how completely he'd remade his image, from a rebellious hippie to the sponsor of cutting-edge scientific research in some of the nation's more conservative institutions.</p><p>This time I wrote the story myself, focusing on the MAPS� sponsored research a psychiatrist named Michael Mithoefer was con� ducting in Charleston, South Carolina, treating with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy mostly female victims of sexual abuse. The story ap� peared in <i>The Washington Post Magazine </i>in November 2007, and much of it has been adapted here in chapter forty-two.</p><p>I was pleased enough with the piece as published, but I felt it barely scratched the surface, both because of rapidly accumulating develop� ments in psychedelic research and because I sensed that the signifi� cance of any given study could not be fully assessed without a deeper understanding of the people behind the studies, not to mention the century-long struggle of Western culture to come to grips with these powerful and, in some ways, profoundly threatening drugs.</p><p>This is what I have attempted in <i>Acid Test. </i>Whatever success I have had I owe entirely to the openness and honesty of the principal charac� ters. Those people listed in the acknowledgments have granted me access to scores of records and privileged documents and agreed to sit for what amounted to a combined total of more than a hundred hours of interviews, unflinchingly answering the most intimate and sensitive questions, revealing things that were personally painful and might very well expose them to negative judgments or significantly compli� cate their lives.</p><p>Their reasons for agreeing to all the above are transparent. They accepted my contention that the full and complete disclosure of all the information surrounding the use and abuse of psychedelic drugs, the history of psychedelic therapy, the motivations of the researchers, and the experiences of the subjects is the best argument for continued and extended support of rigorous and responsible investigation.</p><p>I owe a special debt to those among them who have undergone clinical trials to treat debilitating post-traumatic stress, a disorder that makes it particularly difficult and potentially painful to open up. In particular, I am indebted to Donna Kilgore, Tony Made, and, above all, Nicholas Blackston. They all spent hours reviewing their case his� tories with me, leaving nothing off the record, as well as giving me permission to listen to or watch voluminous audio- and videotapes of their therapeutic sessions. It is hard to imagine a more naked vulnera� bility than allowing an outsider to witness hours spent delving into your deepest, most charged and haunting intimacies explored under the powerful effect of MDMA. Yet, these people made that sacrifice willingly, for no other reason than a sense of duty. They felt the ther� apy benefited them and quite possibly saved their lives, and they believed sharing their stories might help make the therapy available to others.</p><p>I am moved and awed by their courage.</p></p><h2>A to Z Cross Stitch Samplers: The Vanessa Ann Collection</h2><p>Supplies patterns and illustrations for cross-stitch samplers from Antique alphabet to Zippety-do-dah</p><p></p><h2>The Student&#x2019;s Catullus (Oklahoma Series In Classical Culture)</h2><p><p>Although his audacious, erotic, and satirical verses survived the Middle Ages in only a single copy, Catullus has in our time become a standard author in the college Latin curriculum, ranking with Virgil, Horace, and Ovid.</p> <p>In this third edition, thoroughly revised, Daniel H.

Adam Solo, an alien marooned on Earth for more than a thousand years, steals the saucer, hoping to summon a starship to rescue him...but the communications gear is damaged.

A former naval aviator and Vietnam combat veteran, he is a graduate of West Virginia University and the University of Colorado School of Law. He lives in Colorado.1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Adam Solo wedged himself into the chair at the navigator&#x2019;s table in the small compartment behind the bridge and braced himself against the motion of the ship. Rain beat a tattoo on the roof over his head, and wind moaned around the portholes. Although the seas weren&#x2019;t heavy, the ship rolled, pitched and corkscrewed viciously because she was not under way; she was riding sea anchors, being held in one place, at the mercy of the swells. <br>Through the rain-smeared porthole windows Solo could see the flood and spotlights of another ship several hundred feet to port. She was also small, only 350 feet long, roughly the size of the ship Solo was aboard, <i>Atlantic Queen</i>. She also carried massive cranes fore and aft, was festooned with floodlights that lit the deck and the water between the ships and was bobbing like a cork in a maelstrom. <br>Through the open door to the bridge Solo occasionally heard the ringing of the telegraph as the captain signaled the engine room for power to help hold his ship where he wanted her. Johnson was the captain, an overweight, overbearing slob with a sneer engraved on his face and a curse on his lips. He was cursing tonight as he wrestled the helm; Solo ignored the burst of mindless obscenities that reached him during lulls in the wind&#x2019;s song and concentrated on the newspaper before him. <br>&#x201c;Possible Alien Starship Found in Australia,&#x201d; the headline screamed. Beneath that headline, in slightly smaller type, the subhead read, &#x201c;Wreckage buried in coral reef moved ashore for study.&#x201d; <br>Beside the story was a photo of two men and two women posed in front of a massive pile of unidentifiable junk. Solo studied the wreckage. It was not possible to even determine what the original color might have been. The two men were identified in the caption of the photo as Mr. Rip Cantrell, a young man in his early twenties, and Mr. Arthur &#x201c;Egg&#x201d; Cantrell, a rotund, balding man in his fifties. The woman, lean and athletic with her hair in a ponytail, was identified as Charlotte Pine, a former U.S. Air Force test pilot. Beside her stood an Australian archaeologist. Solo studied their faces in the photo, then read the article as rain pounded on the windows and the ship rode the back of the living sea. <br>The article mentioned that this was not the first spacecraft Rip Cantrell had discovered. About a year before, as a young engineering student on an expedition to the Sahara, Cantrell had uncovered a perfectly preserved saucer in a sandstone ledge and had even figured out how to make it fly. He almost lost his life when greedy thugs tried to steal the saucer and its valuable technology. Only with the help of former test pilot Charley Pine had he managed to save that saucer and keep it safe. Soon after, a Frenchman named pierre Artois, an evil genius bent on world conquest, had even managed to steal the famous Roswell saucer the air force had kept hidden for decades at Area 51. Once again, Charley Pine had saved the day when she chased the Roswell saucer and it crashed into the ocean as millions watched on TV. Since then, saucer technology had been revolutionizing the world economy. Great leaps forward in alternative fuels, antigravity and computer technology, solar power, metal fabrication&#x2014;all these advances in man&#x2019;s knowledge were leading to new products and improvements in old ones. <br>Solo was a trim man with short black hair, even features and skin that appeared deeply tanned. He was below average in height, just five and a half feet tall, and weighed about 140 pounds. Tonight he was dressed in jeans, work boots and a dark green Gore-Tex jacket. <br>He leaned back in the chair and closed his eyes, savoring the movement of the ship. <br>Ah, once, long ago, he had been out on this ocean in winter, in a vessel much smaller than this one. How the wind had howled in the rigging; spindrift showered the men and women huddled under blankets and skins, trying to stay warm, as cold rain stung and soaked them. Occasionally the rain turned to sleet, and the ship and people were soon covered with a layer of ice. <br>The motion of this ship brought the memory flooding back. Most of those nights he spent at the steering oar, because he was the best helmsman aboard and he was the captain. In that roaring, wet, absolute darkness the trick was to keep the wind in the same quadrant, keep the unseen sail drawing evenly, feel the way the ship rode the sea, actually become one with the ship. If he held the wind just so and the motion of the ship remained the same, he was steering a straight course. If the sail luffed or the motion of the ship changed, he would hear and feel it. <br>Without a compass, without the moon or stars, raw seamanship was the only way a course could be sailed. Adam Solo had been good at it then, and after a week of storms and clouds and wind brought them all safely to land. <br>Solo&#x2019;s chin was on his chest when the door opened and a heavyset man wearing a suit and tie came in. He tossed a foul-weather coat on the desk. <br>&#x201c;Doctor,&#x201d; Solo said in greeting. <br>Dr. Harrison Douglas, the chairman and CEO of World Pharmaceuticals, was so nervous he couldn&#x2019;t hold still. &#x201c;This is it, Solo,&#x201d; he said as he smacked one fist into a palm. &#x201c;This flying saucer we are bringing up is the key to wealth and power beyond the wildest dreams of anyone alive.&#x201d; Douglas added, almost as an aside to himself, &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s still reasonably intact&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re sure?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;If it holds the secrets I think it does, then yes.&#x201d; Douglas braced himself and glanced out the porthole at the heaving sea between the ships. &#x201c;You still think you can make the computers talk to you?&#x201d; <br>Solo nodded. &#x201c;Yes, but you&#x2019;ve never told me what you want from them.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. I&#x2019;ve kept my mouth firmly shut.&#x201d; Douglas took a deep breath, looked around the little room, then fastened his gaze on Solo. &#x201c;This saucer crashed into the ocean. May be torn all to hell, smashed into bits, but there&#x2019;s a sliver of a chance&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>Douglas turned to the porthole and rubbed the moisture from the glass with his sleeve. &#x201c;&#x2026; A sliver of a chance that one or more of the computers are intact. And if one is, I want you to find the formulas for any drugs that are in the memories.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Are there formulas for drugs?&#x201d; <br>All the experts agreed that interstellar distances were so vast that a starship crew would die before they got to their destination unless their lives were artificially extended. Somehow. <br>&#x201c;Yes, there are drugs,&#x201d; said Douglas. &#x201c;Enough said. You know our deal. I&#x2019;ll pay you ten million cash.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And make billions.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I sincerely hope so,&#x201d; Harrison Douglas said. He jammed his hands in his pockets and stared out the porthole into the night with unseeing eyes. <br>Yes, he did hope to make billions, and if ever there was a drug to generate that kind of money, a drug that prevented aging was undoubtedly it. Well, Douglas was in the Big Pharma business. If arresting aging involved drugs, by God, World Pharmaceuticals could figure out how to make them. Every man and woman on the planet would like to stop the aging process, or if that proved impossible, at least slow it down, preserve quality of life and extend it free from the diseases that aging causes or enables. An extra ten good years&#x2014;how much would that be worth to the average Joe? Or twenty? Or thirty? America, Europe, Arabia, India, Japan, China&nbsp;&#x2026; the possibilities were awe-inspiring. <br>Harrison Douglas twitched with excitement. <br>Douglas smacked a fist into the palm of his other hand. <i>Yes, the people of the saucers must have possessed an antiaging drug.</i> <br>Douglas was musing on how much money such a drug would make World, and himself, of course, the CEO who made it happen, when he heard Captain Johnson give a shout. <br>Douglas glanced through the porthole. He saw waves washing over a shape even darker than the night sea. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s up!&#x201d; he said excitedly. With that he grabbed the foul-weather coat and dashed through the door onto the bridge. He went straight through, right by the captain, onto the open wing of the bridge and charged down a ladder to the main deck. <br>Adam Solo slowly folded the page of the newspaper that contained the story of the Australian artifact and placed it in his shirt pocket. He pulled on a cap and stepped onto the bridge. Ignoring the captain at the helm, Solo walked to the unprotected wing of the bridge and gazed down into the heaving dark sea as the wind and rain tore at him. The wind threatened to tear his cap from his head, so he removed it. Dr. Douglas was there on the main deck at the rail, holding on with both hands. <br>Floodlights from both ships lit the area between the ships and the heavy cables that disappeared into the water. From the angle of the cables, it was obvious that what they held was just beneath the surface. Snatches of the commands the chief on deck shouted to the winch operators reached Solo. Gazing intently at the scene before him, he ignored them. <br>As Solo watched, swells separated the ships slightly, tightening the cables, and something again broke the surface. It was a mound, dark as the black water; swells broke over it. <br>As quickly as it came into view, the shape disappeared again as the ships rolled toward each other. <br>Over the next five minutes the deck crews aboard both ships tightened their cables inch by inch, lifting the black shape to the surface again, then higher and higher until finally it was free of the water and hung suspended between the ships. The spotlights played upon it, a black, saucer-shaped object, perfectly round and thickest in the middle. It was not small&#x2014;the diameter was about ninety feet&#x2014;and it was heavy; the cables that held it were taut as violin strings, and the ships listed toward it a noticeable amount. <br>Solo stepped back into the sheltered area of the bridge and wiped the rain from his hair with his hand, then settled the cap onto his head as he listened to the voices on the bridge loudspeaker. The deck chiefs of this ship and the other vessel were talking to each other on handheld radios, coordinating their efforts as the saucer was inched over the deck of this ship. The ship&#x2019;s radio picked up the conversation and piped it here so that the captain could listen in and, if he wished, take part in the conversation. <br>A moment later Dr. Douglas came in from the bridge wing, pulling the door shut behind him and brushing water from his coat. <br>&#x201c;Well, we got it up, Doctor,&#x201d; Captain Johnson said heartily. &#x201c;And they said it couldn&#x2019;t be done. Ha! You owe us some serious money.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I will when you have it safely on the dock in Newark,&#x201d; Douglas replied. <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get &#x2019;er there, you can bet on that,&#x201d; Johnson said confidently. &#x201c;The company has big money ridin&#x2019; on it. They promised every man in the crew a bonus, including me. Gonna be nice money, and I&#x2019;ll be damn glad to get it.&#x201d; <br>It took twenty minutes for the deck crew to get the dark, ominous ovoid shape deposited onto the waiting timbers on <i>Atlantic Queen</i>&#x2019;s deck and lashed down. The saucer was so large it filled the space between the bridge and the forward crane and protruded over both rails. It seemed to dwarf the ship on which it rode, pushing it deeper into the sea. <br>When the cables that had lifted the saucer from the sea floor had been released, the sea anchors were brought aboard and the ship got under way. Solo felt the ride improve immediately as the screws bit into the dark water. The other ship, which had helped raise the saucer, had already dissolved into the darkness. <br>&#x201c;There you are,&#x201d; Johnson said heartily to Douglas, who had his nose almost against the window, staring at the spaceship. &#x201c;Your flyin&#x2019; saucer&#x2019;s settin&#x2019; like a hen on her nest, safe and sound, and she ain&#x2019;t goin&#x2019; noplace.&#x201d; <br>Douglas flashed a grin and dashed for the ladder to the main deck. <br>Solo went back into the navigator&#x2019;s shack. He emerged seconds later carrying a hard plastic case and descended the bridge wing ladder to the main deck, where the sailors were milling around, inspecting the saucer while they rigged ropes across it and chained the ropes to padeyes in the deck. Several of them were touching the machine&nbsp;&#x2026; and marveling. <br>As Douglas watched, Solo opened his case, took out a wand and adjusted the switches and knobs within, then donned a headset. Carrying the instrument case, he began a careful inspection of the saucer, all of it that he could see from the deck. He even climbed the mast of the forward crane to get a look at the top of it, then returned to the deck. As he walked and climbed around he glanced occasionally at the gauges in his case, but mostly he concentrated on visually inspecting the surface of the ship. He could see no damage whatsoever. <br>Douglas asked him a couple of questions, but Solo didn&#x2019;t answer, so eventually he stopped asking. One by one the tired sailors left the deck, heading for their berths. They had been hard at work for almost twenty hours and were exhausted. <br>Solo crawled under the saucer and lay there studying his instrument. Finally he took off his headset, stowed it back inside the case and closed it. <br>One of the officers squatted down a few feet away. This was the first mate. &#x201c;No radiation?&#x201d; he asked Solo. The sailor was in his early thirties, with unkempt wind-blown hair and acne scars on his face. <br>&#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t seem to be.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Boy, that&#x2019;s amazing.&#x201d; The mate reached and placed his hand on the cold black surface immediately over his head. &#x201c;So this is the one that went straight into the ocean like a bullet from over a hundred thousand feet up,&#x201d; said the mate, whose name was DeVries. &#x201c;Yeah, I heard all about it on TV. Saw all those reruns of the saucers chasin&#x2019; each other over Manhattan. Bet this thing made one hell of a splash when it hit! I didn&#x2019;t figure we&#x2019;d find it in one piece, I can tell you. An impact like that&#x2026;&#x201d; <br>Solo studied the belly of the saucer as the raw sea wind played with his hair. At least here, under the saucer, he was sheltered from the rain. <br>&#x201c;Everything inside is probably torn loose, I figure,&#x201d; DeVries continued, warming to his subject. &#x201c;Scrambled up inside there like a dozen broken eggs. And that crazy Frenchman flying it must still be inside, squashed flat as a road-killed possum. Couldn&#x2019;t nobody live through a smashup like that. He&#x2019;s gotta be as dead as Napoleon Bonaparte and getting pretty ripe, I&#x2019;ll bet. This thing&#x2019;s been in the water a whole month.&#x201d; <br>The first mate turned to Douglas and asked, &#x201c;So, Doctor, how come you&#x2019;re spending all this money raisin&#x2019; this flyin&#x2019; saucer off the ocean floor?&#x201d; <br>Douglas said matter-of-factly, &#x201c;Scientific curiosity.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Eight million bucks is a lot to pay to scratch that itch,&#x201d; DeVries said thoughtfully, a remark Douglas let pass without comment. The salvage operation was going to cost Douglas at least that much. <br>As those two watched, Adam Solo had placed his hand on the hatch handle and held it there. Now, after ten seconds or so, he pulled down on one end of the handle and turned it sideways. The handle rotated and the hatch opened above his head. Water began dripping out. <br>Not much, but some. The saucer had been lying in 250 feet of water; if the integrity of the hull had been broken, seawater under pressure would have filled the interior. This might be leakage from the ship&#x2019;s tank, or merely condensation. Solo wiped a drip off the hatch lip and tasted it. He was relieved&#x2014;it wasn&#x2019;t saltwater. <br>Now Solo inspected the yawning hole. He stuck the wand inside and studied the panel on his Geiger counter. &#x201c;Background radiation,&#x201d; he told Douglas, who smiled in a self-satisfied way and rubbed his hands together, a gesture that Solo had noticed he used often. <br>Solo turned off the Geiger counter. He carefully wrapped ...</p><h2>Pioneer Lady&#39;s Country Christmas</h2><p>A celebration of Christmas past combines recipes with stories, anecdotes, poems, and drawings that evoke the traditions, feasts, and festivities of the holiday season</p><p>Rekindle the memories of an old-fashioned Christmas with <i>The Pioneer Lady's Country Christmas</i>.

In one bloody day&nbsp;more than&nbsp;800 British troops, 500 of their allies, and at least 2,000 Zulus were killed in a staggering defeat for the British empire. The consequences of the battle echoed brutally across the following decades as Britain took ruthless revenge on the Zulu people. In <i>Zulu Rising</i> Ian Knight shows that the brutality of the battle was the result of an inevitable clash between two aggressive warrior traditions. For the first time he gives full weight to the Zulu experience and explores the reality of the fighting through the eyes of men who took part on both sides, looking into the human heart of this savage conflict. Based on new research, including previously unpublished material, Zulu oral history, and new archaeological evidence from the battlefield, this is the definitive account of a battle that has shaped the political fortunes of the Zulu people to this day.</p></p><p><p><b>Ian Knight</b> is the leading authority on the Anglo-Zulu War and has written over thirty highly regarded publications on Zulu history, including the award-winning <i>National Army Museum Book of the Zulu War</i>.

Liebling joined the staff of <i>The New Yorker</i> in 1935 and wrote for the magazine until his death in 1963. Fred Warner and James Barbour are emeritus professors at the University of New Mexico.<br>Liebling (1904-1963) was an impeccable stylist, whether covering the vagaries of the American press, the glories of France or the simple pleasures of good food. He may have reserved his best literary efforts, however, for boxing, a contention borne out by the 15 essays in this collection, all originally published in the New Yorker between 1952 and 1963. His talent for extended metaphor is beautifully displayed in "The University of Eighth Avenue," about Stillman's Gym in Manhattan; for a simile in a class of its own, see his description of heavyweight champion Ingemar Johansson going down "like a double portion of Swedish pancakes with lingonberries and sour cream." Liebling's brevity happily infects his description of Indianapolis as "built around two large monuments to the wartime dead, which set the urban tone." These pieces are not blow-by-blow, round-by-round accounts of great fights, but observations of sporting people and places. Anyone who appreciates good prose, if not boxing, will find surprises and satisfaction here. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Accompany Them with Singing--The Christian Funeral</h2><p><p>Thomas Long begins this fascinating volume by describing how the Christian funeral developed historically, theologically, and liturgically, and then discusses recent cultural trends in funeral practices, including the rise in both cremations and memorial services. He describes the basic pattern for a funeral service, details options in funeral planning, identifies characteristics of a "good funeral," and provides thoughtful guidance for preaching at a funeral.</p><p>Long also notes a disturbing trend toward funeral services that seem theologically right and pastorally caring, but actually depart from the primary aims of the Christian funeral. He argues that a new, less-theological and less-satisfying service that focuses on the mourner has begun to erode the Christian view. He contrasts the ancient grand community drama with today's trend toward body-less memorial services that focus primarily on the living and grief management. This is a loss for the church, he argues, and he calls for the church to reclaim the classic metaphor.</p></p><p><b>Thomas G. Long</b> is the Bandy Professor of Preaching at Candler School of Theology, Emory University, in Atlanta, Georgia. He is one of the most popular preachers in the United States today. He is the author of several books, including <i>The Senses of Preaching</i> (WJK), <i>Preaching and the Literary Forms of the Bible</i>, and <i>Whispering the Lyrics: Sermons for Lent and Easter</i>.Starred Review. Long, a homiletics professor and well-regarded preacher, argues that funerals have become spiritually impoverished and need revitalization. Providing a comprehensive review of the history, traditions and theology of Christian funerals, Long notes that recent decades have seen both growing comfort with cremation and an increased preference for disembodied memorial services offering closure. In defiance of this trend, Long argues that just as bodies are present for baptism and weddings, they should be present for funerals. Long laments that eulogies celebrating individual lives often replace gospel preaching and advocates instead that liturgies emphasize a community's conveyance of a beloved's body to its final resting place, worshipping as they go. Delineating the purposes of a good funeral, Long urges clergy and congregations to embrace funerals as opportunities to act out one more time the great and hopeful drama of how the Christian life moves from death to life and from baptism to resurrection. This book promises to be a welcome theological resource and practical guide for pastors and others who care for the dying and officiate at Christian funerals. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Here are unfaithful soldiers, ghostly lovers, whalers on stormy seas, cuckolds and tricksters. By turns funny, plain-speaking and melancholic, these songs evoke a lost world and, with their melodies provided, record a vital musical tradition. Generations of inhabitants have helped shape the English countryside - but it has profoundly shaped us too. It has provoked a huge variety of responses from artists, writers, musicians and people who live and work on the land - as well as those who are travelling through it. English Journeys celebrates this long tradition with a series of twenty books on all aspects of the countryside, from stargazey pie and country churches, to man&#39;s relationship with nature and songs celebrating the patterns of the countryside (as well as ghosts and love-struck soldiers).</p><p>Ralph Vaughan Williams (1872-1958) was one of England&#39;s greatest composers, and among the first people to travel the countryside to collect folk songs and preserve them for future generations. A. L. Lloyd (1908-1982), usually known as Bert, was a folk singer and folklorist who grew up listening to his mother singing gypsy songs, and eventually wrote them down. Together with Vaughan Williams, he helped rescue traditional English music from extinction.</p><h2>100 Pounds of Popcorn</h2><p>What would YOU do if you found a 100-pound bag of popping corn?

Thousands of passengers paid the nickel fare to experience what it was like to ride beneath Broadway and other traffic-clogged city streets from lower Manhattan to the Upper West Side. Here is the story of the daring and demanding construction project that made it possible for the city&#x2019;s first &#x201c;straphangers&#x201d; to travel miles in minutes.<br>In a lively fact-filled text and incredibly detailed pictures, gifted technical artist David Weitzman brings the mechanics of this incredible public works project to life and captures the can-do spirit of engineers and workers.

His first piece for the <i>Times</i> was a profile of Raymond Carver for the Sunday magazine in 1983, and he has been on staff at the newspaper since 1986 as an editor, metro reporter, national cultural correspondent, theater columnist and theater critic, among other things. His writing about baseball includes three cover stories for the <i>Times Magazine</i> (for whom he has also profiled E. L. Doctorow, Martin Cruz Smith, the Harvard Admissions Department, the New York Public Library and Cher) and he has regularly contributed first-person essays and participatory features to the paper. These include accounts of several bicycle journeys (from Hanoi to Ho Chi Minh City and from San Francisco to New York City, among them); of a walk the length of Broadway, from Yonkers to the Battery; of canoeing down the Hudson; of skating on all of New York City's skating rinks and of batting in all of New York City's batting cages.&nbsp;<p>He has written for <i>Sports Illustrated</i>, <i>Sport, Esquire, Manhattan Inc., Vogue, Mademoiselle, Redbook, Harpers' Bazaar</i>, the <i>Hartford Courant</i> and the <i>St. Petersburg Times</i>. He is the author, with the dancer Savion Glover, of <i>Savion!

He must be a tough character, with endurance and the ability to keep his temper and self-control, he must be unimpeachably honest, courteous, impartial, and firm, and he must compel respect from everyone!</i><p><b> -- Branch Rickey</b></p></blockquote><p>Just about the first thing they teach you at umpire school is how to yank your mask off without upsetting your hat. Umpires place great stock in their appearance, and if you're trying to make a call or follow a play with your hat askew or caught in your mask straps or -- the worst -- spilled in the dirt, you look foolish, inept, exactly the image you don't want the ballplayers, the managers and coaches, or the fans to have of you.</p><p>Like everything else in umpiring, or at least in umpire instruction, the method for removing the mask is reasoned and precise. You keep your head straight, your eyes forward, and move your hand to your mask, not the other way around. The only reason you remove your mask in the first place is to watch a play on the field, and you never want to turn your eyes down, away from the play, even for a moment. There's no worse feeling, umpires will tell you, than looking up from an instant's distraction, seeing the ball on the ground, and not knowing how it got there.</p><p>Anyway, you grab the mask with your left hand, wrapping your thumb, forefinger, and middle finger around it at seven o'clock. You don't use your whole hand. You can't, really, because your ball-andstrike indicator is also in the left hand, held snug against the palm by the ring finger and the pinkie. So with the three available fingers, in one swift motion you pull the mask straight out from your face to clear the bill of your cap, then straight up and off. You don't toss it aside; the catcher is the only one who ever throws a mask. If you have to come out from behind the plate and run to a spot to make a call, if you have to hold up your arms to signal foul, even if you have to use your left hand and pump hard with your elbow to sell the call that a ball was touched in fair territory, you hold your mask tight.</p><p>This is all, of course, rudimentary, something a professional umpire will do with muscle memory and a shrug, the way a concertmaster will toss off a warm-up arpeggio. But the reward is real. When you do it right, with the casual adroitness that approximates instinct, it looks both graceful and aggressive, leaving you, the plate umpire, properly possessed of the authority and dignity of your office.</p><p>Naturally, for a beginner it is a harder trick to perform than it sounds, and for me, a fifty-two-year-old student umpire, it was the first of many skills that looked simple and proved annoyingly resistant to mastery. During school drills, I'd get it right a couple of times, then let my concentration slip, undoubtedly because of something else to focus on. I'd come out from behind the plate to follow the path of an outfield fly ball or to straddle the third-base line to judge a line drive fair or foul, pull off the mask, and my hat would end up on the ground -- usually smack-dab on the baseline so it was marked with a telltale streak of lime -- or merely jostled and tipped crooked, the bill off-center like a rapper's, or tipped forward and shading my eyes. How you can pull your mask upward and have your hat tip forward I don't know, but that it is possible I am a witness. It wasn't until school was done and I went out on the field to work an actual game and my frustration continued that I solved the problem for good (or thought I did) -- by buying a hat with a narrower brim. Who knew different-size baseball-cap brims even existed?</p><p>It turns out that an ordinary baseball cap has a brim about 3 1?4 inches wide, with eight seams sewn into it. The brim of a base umpire's cap is a little narrower, maybe 3 inches and six seams wide, and the brim of an ordinary plate umpire's hat, which is what we were issued in school, is narrower still, 2 1?2 inches and four seams. The gradations downward continue until you get to a kind of skullcap with a 1 1?2-inch brim that looks like an appetizer portion of cantaloupe. Umpires call this version the beanie, and when you remove your mask, it makes you look like a refugee from the nineteenth century. But I liked the eccentricity of it and bought one.</p><p>Umpires, however, cannot afford eccentricity. Later I would discover a scene in the popular film <i>A League of Their Own</i> in which the actor Tom Hanks, playing a manager, accosts an umpire wearing the beanie. "Did anyone ever tell you you look like a penis with that little hat on?" he says. But I wasn't aware of this at the time, and the first game I wore it, I noticed the teenaged players giggling at me behind their hands. Whenever I made a call one of them didn't care for, he rolled his eyes and gave me a look -- what a geek!</p><p>Immediately after the game, I went back to the store and bought a hat with a two-inch brim, and when I came back the next day to work a game in the same league, I held much more authority in the eyes of the players. Or so it seemed to me, which is really all that mattered.</p><p>At this point perhaps you are thinking, okay, taking the mask off, enough already. This is far too much detail about a mundane thing. And that's correct, except that the process I just described is a perfect analog of learning to be an umpire. You master the fundamentals, you cast them off when they don't serve, and in the end you accommodate yourself to the game and its participants. It turns out you're not alone out there. It only feels that way.</p><p>The impetus for this book was a visit I made in January 2005 to the Jim Evans Academy of Professional Umpiring in Kissimmee, Florida, in order to write a story for the <i>New York Times</i>, where I work as a reporter. I thought it would be a lark, a chance to talk baseball rules and baseball trivia -- I'm the kind of baseball fan who has never gotten over his boyhood obsession, who reads the sports page before the front page and pores over box scores as though they were hieroglyphic finds -- not to mention a chance to wear short sleeves in midwinter.</p><p>But what I found there in three days of observing -- the whole course of instruction runs five weeks -- was weird and intriguing, an amalgam of strict vocational schooling in subject matter as concrete as auto mechanics and behavioral instruction as delicate and interpretative as you'll find in any acting workshop. Moreover, virtually everything I saw was new to me.</p><p>The experience persuaded me to write two more stories for the paper that year about umpiring. For one, I went on the road with a crew of Double A umpires, three young men locked together for a season, traveling long distances in a van packed with their belongings through Texas, Missouri, Kansas, and Arkansas. For the other, I met in major league ballparks and four-star hotels with Bruce Froemming, then the senior umpire in the major leagues.</p><p>I came away from these three stories convinced that a land of umpires exists, that it has citizens, laws, and a culture, and that it is exotic enough -- both in the context of baseball and the context of, well, the known world -- to warrant further exploring. Indeed, the presumption of this book is that professional umpires are an unusually isolated and circumscribed group, sort of like the inhabitants of a remote country that few people have ever visited, and that I am the sociologist who was dispatched to send back word of what life is like there.</p><p>I spent just about all of 2006 and 2007 and part of 2008 in the land of umpires, beginning when I went back to the Evans academy and enrolled as a student in the five-week program. From then on I went where the tales of professional umpires took me, sort of like a ball bouncing erratically across a pebble-strewn infield. It wasn't a comprehensive investigation, but for the most part it was a lot of fun.</p><p>Among other places, my travels took me to Cocoa, Florida, where a team of former professional umpires was evaluating umpire-school graduates for jobs in the minor leagues; to Cedar City, Utah, where a former air force engineer, Grant Secrist, was keeping alive his quest to create a simulator, akin to the one used by fighter pilots, to train major league umpires in calling balls and strikes; to the exurbs of Phoenix, Arizona, and the farm country of Ohio, homes of two former umpires -- Don Denkinger and Larry Barnett, respectively -- who made two of the most controversial calls in World Series history; to southern Connecticut to visit with the candid ex-commissioner of baseball, Fay Vincent; and to central California, where Doug Harvey, the legendary National League umpire who narrowly missed being the ninth umpire inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2007, waxed formidable and egocentric about what it takes to make it in the major leagues.</p><p>I spent several weeks with minor league umpires in places like Boise, Idaho; Huntsville, Alabama; Omaha, Nebraska; Bowie, Maryland; Des Moines, Iowa; Fresno, California; Trenton, New Jersey; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania; and Portland, Maine, getting to know some of the young men (and one young woman) who were willing, remarkably, to put up with endless indignities -- rotten pay, long road trips, mediocre hotels, cramped locker rooms, not to mention the utter thanklessness of the umpiring task -- for up to a decade or more in pursuit of the unlikely possibility of a major league job opportunity.</p><p>To talk to major league umpires, I went to spring training in Florida in 2006 and Arizona in 2006 and 2007. I went to the 2006 All-Star weekend in Pittsburgh and over two seasons spent regular-season seri...</p></p><h2>The Power Of The Other</h2><p>&#34;The startling effect other people have on you, from the boardroom to the bedroom and beyond--and what to do about it.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Children Just Like Me</h2><p>Title: Children Just Like Me( In Association with United Nations Children's Fund) &lt;&gt;Binding: Hardcover &lt;&gt;Author: BarnabasKindersley &lt;&gt;Publisher: DKPublishing(DorlingKindersley)</p><p></p><h2>A Case for Irony (The Tanner Lectures on Human Values)</h2><p><p>In 2001, <i>Vanity Fair</i> declared that the Age of Irony was over. Joan Didion has lamented that the United States in the era of Barack Obama has become an "irony-free zone." Jonathan Lear in his 2006 book <i>Radical Hope</i> looked into America&#x2019;s heart to ask how might we dispose ourselves if we came to feel our way of life was coming to an end. Here, he mobilizes a squad of philosophers and a psychoanalyst to once again forge a radical way forward, by arguing that no genuinely human life is possible without irony.</p><p>Becoming human should not be taken for granted, Lear writes. It is something we accomplish, something we get the hang of, and like Kierkegaard and Plato, Lear claims that irony is one of the essential tools we use to do this. For Lear and the participants in his Socratic dialogue, irony is not about being cool and detached like a player in a Woody Allen film. That, as Johannes Climacus, one of Kierkegaard&#x2019;s pseudonymous authors, puts it, &#x201c;is something only assistant professors assume.&#x201d; Instead, it is a renewed commitment to living seriously, to experiencing every disruption that shakes us out of our habitual ways of tuning out of life, with all its vicissitudes. While many over the centuries have argued differently, Lear claims that our feelings and desires tend toward order, a structure that irony shakes us into seeing. Lear&#x2019;s exchanges with his interlocutors strengthen his claims, while his experiences as a practicing psychoanalyst bring an emotionally gripping dimension to what is at stake&#x2015;the psychic costs and benefits of living with irony.</p></p><p>Jonathan Lear is John U. Nef Distinguished Service Professor in the Committee on Social Thought and the Department of Philosophy at the University of Chicago.Before we can claim to live a truly examined life, says Jonathan Lear, we need to pass the test of ironic self-scrutiny at something approaching the level set by Socrates and Kierkegaard. Following the contours of the subtle case for radical irony Lear makes turns out to be an intellectual adventure in its own right. (J. M. Coetzee)<br><br>Jonathan Lear's re-reading of the significance of irony for getting the hang of a genuinely human existence is an unheimlich maneuver that brings religion and psychoanalysis into productive conversation with philosophy, and induces characteristically sharp and creative responses from his interlocutors: an exemplary instance of the virtues of the Tanner Lectures format. (Stephen Mulhall, University of Oxford)<br><br>Lear performs a valuable service. He shows us just how far the contemporary usage of irony diverges from an older, far more appealing meaning, according to which irony is a portal to self-knowledge. (Andrew Stark <i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2011-12-22)<br><br>Lear's book provides intellectual pleasure of a very high order: its distinctions are careful, its prose lucid and elegant, and its examples suggestive and well chosen...You should read this book.

He slogged through the foot of snow quickly piling up on Highway 191 to the Bar H outside of Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Zeke, his U.S. Navy SEAL combat assault dog, a Belgian Malinois, walked at his side, looking up, a worried expression on his black face.<br><br>As he gripped the leather leash, Talon gasped for air. They were at five thousand feet in the middle of a late-May blizzard, no less. He could barely see the Snake River hundreds of feet below and to his right. On his right was a rocky, craggy mountain rising 6,200 feet, hidden by the blizzard.<br><br>He wiped his mouth, head down, the wind howling and gusting, beating against his wet, cold body. Miles earlier, it had rained. He and Zeke were drenched as they slogged alongside the muddy berm of the highway.<br><br>Talon had been born in this area so he knew he was in trouble. Few cars or trucks were on the road because of the unexpected blizzard.<br><br>What made his problem worse: the PTSD symptoms acquired during his tenure as a Navy SEAL. Talon couldn't just hop on a plane, ride in a bus or be inside any enclosed area if a panic attack hit him. When medically and honorably discharged from the SEALs, he had to walk from Coronado on the West Coast back home to Jackson Hole. He knew the journey would get dicey.<br><br>Lucky for him now, he wore his Navy camo coat and he had gloves. He took the wool blanket out of his sixty-five-pound rucksack and wrapped it around Zeke. The Belgian Malinois, who was often mistaken for a German shepherd, was not prepared for a blizzard, either. Zeke was short-haired and needed the protection. Talon tried his best to keep his loyal dog dry and warm.<br><br>He was so close to getting home. God, hadn't he suffered enough? Done enough for his country? Ever since the Taliban had captured him and Hayden, his SEAL partner, his life had disintegrated before him. They had been jumped by the enemy and Zeke had escaped and taken off. The dog had run thirty miles over rough, mountainous terrain to Camp Bravo, a forward operating base in Afghanistan.<br><br>He wouldn't be alive today if Zeke hadn't done what he did. After regaining consciousness in the hospital at Bagram Air Base near Kabul, he learned that Zeke had barked furiously, getting the SEALs' attention at Bravo. Zeke had led a six-man SEAL team back to where he and Hayden had been captured and were being tortured. During the firefight, Zeke had taken a bullet in the shoulder, nearly died himself.<br><br>Talon tried to shake off the memory of the torture. His gut churned with cramps from not eating for three days. He had to get home. He <em>had</em> to make it to the Bar H.<br><br>But would he survive? With every short, shallow breath that tore out of his mouth, Talon wheezed. His lungs were filling up with fluid, and he desperately needed antibiotics and pure oxygen. He cursed his bad luck. In his soggy mind, the fever making him hallucinate, Talon figured he had about a mile to go.<br><br>He was either going to die of pneumonia out in this storm or he was going to die of hypothermia. How ironic was that? He'd survived gunshot wounds and torture only to freeze to death out in this damn blizzard? If Talon hadn't been so exhausted, he'd be pissed.<br><br>The sky was a dark, gunmetal gray. He knew it was probably around seven in the morning, but it looked like early dawn due to the heavy, dark clouds carrying the brunt of the blizzard. Talon stumbled over his own feet and fell hard on the berm. He threw out his hands, releasing the leash. Zeke stopped, wagging his long brushy tail, whining and licking the side of his face as Talon struggled to sit up. The world whirled around him and Talon cursed softly, tightly shutting his eyes. Come on! Dammit, if he could survive BUD/S training to become a SEAL, he sure as hell could get through this!<br><br>Gasping, grunting, he used every last bit of his strength and pushed himself unsteadily to his feet.<br><br>He leaned over, placing his gloved hand on Zeke's strong back, which had carried so many loads for him over in Afghanistan for three years. He groped for and found the leash. Talon awkwardly patted his dog's head, saw the worry in Zeke's large brown eyes. Zeke deserved a helluva lot better than being out in this deathly blizzard.<br><br>Talon winced, lowering his head against the stinging bits of ice and snow striking his face. Hayden's screams of pain haunted him in his nightmares. He'd never get his friend's cries out of his head. And it drained Talon's will to live. Add to that his mother's battle with cancer.<br><br>Talon doggedly pushed forward. He felt Zeke's comforting weight against his knee. The dog was shepherding him along. Zeke was a bona fide hero. He had been awarded a Purple Heart and a Silver Star by the Navy for his heroic efforts to save his and Hayden's lives. Only, Hayden hadn't survived. Shit.<br><br>The past was overlaying the present. The fever had him in its grip and Talon wasn't sure if he was in a Wyoming blizzard or back in a snowstorm in the Hindu Kush Mountains of Afghanistan. And when the fever rolled out like a tide in his head, Talon would realize he was in Wyoming, trying to reach the Bar H. Trying to get close enough to home to ask for help, to let his mother know he was near.<br><br>Since his mother had contracted breast cancer, Talon had sent most of his paycheck to her because she couldn't afford the horrendous, mounting medical bills. He'd wanted to help her as much as he could. As a result, when he got wounded and discharged, he had no bank account except for five hundred dollars in a savings account to get him home to Jackson Hole. And that money was mostly gone as he walked across half of the United States to reach Wyoming.<br><br>Jesus, the fever was messing with his head. Talon's breath was ragged and fast. Dizziness struck him in waves. His lungs were drowning in fluid and he couldn't get the oxygen he needed. No oxygen, no strength. Only brute determination kept him going.<br><br>A blast of frigid air struck Talon. He slipped, lost his footing and went down. Hard. His head slammed into the snow and the berm below it. Darkness took him briefly.<br><br>He felt his dog's tongue licking his bearded cheek. As he fumbled, tried to rise, the last of his strength ebbed. He was going to freeze to death out here.<br><br>Talon lay there gasping for air, feeling the bubbles of liquid in his lungs. Death stalked him. He closed his eyes, cheek pressed into the snow, feeling nothing because his flesh was numb. Something snapped deep within. Something so primal, so visceral, that all he could do was lie there, helpless. Just as he'd hung helplessly, strung up, his wrists tied with ropes over an overhead beam, toes barely touching the dirt floor. He was forced to watch Hayden being tortured. Oh, God...<br><br>Talon wanted death to take him. He was so very, very sorry he wouldn't be able to help his mother. She was a survivor. Grief and sadness wound through him like a cold, icy river flooding him. He was so dehydrated he couldn't even cry.<br><br>His SEAL team friends would find out sooner or later that he'd died of hypothermia on an unnamed highway somewhere in Wyoming during a freak blizzard. What a screwed-up ending.<br><br>Talon closed his eyes.<br><br>Well, it looked like the blizzard was going to kill him. It felt good to just rest. To lie on his side, the snow all around him.<br><br>Zeke whined and paced around him, licking his face, trying to get him up. A hoarse sound scraped out of his throat. It was as close to a sob as he would get under these circumstances. Talon wasn't afraid to die.<br><br>Zeke lay down next to him, his moist, hot breath across his face. In Afghanistan, in the cold mountains, Zeke was like a warm, living blanket to Talon. He would lie at his side, their bodies glued to each other, keeping one another warm through those icy, frigid nights.<br><br>He couldn't let Zeke stay out here. The dog would die in the blizzard, too.<br><br>And that was what forced Talon to try to get up. To move. Gasping, his breath noisy and ragged, he struggled to move his numb legs. They were weighted down, hard to move. For a moment, the fever receded and Talon's head cleared. His black lashes froze to his cheeks and he couldn't force open his eyes. Somehow, he managed to pull his hand up, scrub his face and force the lashes to break free. Blinking rapidly, Talon got them open. Up! He had to get up! Zeke couldn't freeze out here. Talon couldn't let that happen.<br><br>Just as Talon got to his feet, wobbling and staggering around, he saw headlights come out of the thick veil of snow. Blinking unsurely, he thought he was seeing things&#x2014;hallucinations due to his high fever.<br><br>Zeke whined, placing his strong body against Talon's leg to help him remain upright.<br><br>Talon gasped for air, like a fish thrown out of the water. He jammed his hands down on his knees, head down, trying to stay upright as the big, black SUV appeared like an apparition out of the blinding blizzard. It stopped in front of him.<br><br>A car door opened and slammed shut.<br><br>Jesus, he had to be imagining this! No one in their right mind was out in a blizzard like this. Wyoming people knew to stay home to stay safe. Was this how death happened?<br><br>Zeke barked a warning.<br><br>There really <em>was</em> someone walking toward him! Zeke was in combat assault dog mode. Anyone making a move toward Talon was seen as the enemy. Zeke's growl rumbled warningly, and the hackles of fur stood up on his neck.<br><br>"Allow," Talon rasped to Zeke. The command to the dog meant not to attack, but allow that person to touch or be around him. Instantly, Zeke stopped growling and watched the person who was heavily bundled up in a coat.<br><br>Talon forced himself to stand. He was so dizzy he had to step back so that he wouldn't fall over. He tried to focus his eyes on the person coming around the SUV. Whoever it was, he or she wore a down black jacket, white knit cap, a thick muffler around their neck, hands positioned beneath their armpits.<br><br>And then the apparition spoke.<br><br>"Hey, climb in. No one should be out in this blizzard."<br><br>A woman's voice. Husky. Filled with concern. She eyed him worriedly, her blue eyes warm. The snow-flakes were landing on strands of her black hair peeking out from beneath her white knit cap.<br><br>"Hey?" she called. "Are you all right?"<br><br>Her hand came to rest around his upper arm, steadying him. <em>Jesus, she's real!</em> His mind shorted out. He couldn't talk. He knew he looked like what he was: a homeless military vet. He hadn't bathed in ten days. His hair was long by military standards. He hadn't shaved in God knew how long.<br><br>She saw the dog, suddenly becoming wary.<br><br>"Won't hurt you," Talon forced out, his voice rough and barely intelligible.<br><br>"Good to know. I'm Cat Edwin. Come on, I need to get you inside my SUV."<br><br>Her hand became firmer on his arm as he tried to take a step toward it. Everything whirled and he halted, shutting his eyes. "Pneumonia," he muttered.<br><br>"Yeah, I hear it. You need medical attention pronto." Cat slid her arm around his waist and pulled his one arm across her shoulder. "I'll help you into my SUV. What's your name?" He looked awfully familiar, but she couldn't place him. Right now, she didn't have time to figure out why.<br><br>Cat slowly guided him toward the passenger side of her SUV. The man could barely keep his feet beneath him, his knees continuing to collapse beneath him.<br><br>"Talon," he managed, his feet barely working. In the next breath, he rasped, "Holt."<br><br>Cat gasped. Now she knew who he was. Sandy Holt's son! "Okay, Talon Holt, hang on." Cat reached for the handle and pulled open the door. "Let's get you inside. You're wet and freezing."<br><br>He hesitated. "My dog..."<br><br>"He's coming along, too," she reassured him.<br><br>Talon grunted and worked to climb into the SUV. He had a helluva time getting into the seat and she practically shoved him into the SUV. Zeke jumped into the front, sitting on the floorboards between his legs, facing him.<br><br>The door slammed shut. He could feel heat in the SUV. It felt wonderful. Talon lay back, closing his eyes, gasping for air, his lungs hurting with each wheezing breath.<br><br>Cat climbed in and shut the door. "I'm going to the Bar H. It's about a mile up the road. The roads are closed beyond that. I'll get you to the ranch and try to help you there."<br><br>He had to be dreaming. Talon couldn't answer, too weak to speak. He felt Zeke's warm, wet tongue licking his hand. Just as she put the SUV into motion, his last memory was of Cat Edwin's face. She was attractive, slightly curled strands of black hair across her broad brow. He liked her large, readable blue eyes. Talon had seen every emotion in them. Her face was oval with wide cheekbones. Her nose was clean with slightly flared nostrils. He especially liked that wide, soft mouth of hers. If Talon had been healthy, he sure as hell would have wanted to know her a lot better. And with that last thought, he sank into unconsciousness.<br><br></p><h2>All the Pretty Horses</h2><p>Lulled to sleep by her mother&#39;s singing of the traditional lullaby, a little girl dreams of all sorts of horses.</p><p></p><h2>George MacDonald: A Biography of Scotland&#x2019;s Beloved Storyteller</h2><p>In this extensive biography, Michael Phillips paints a revealing portrait of George MacDonald. Phillips uses the facts of MacDonald&#39;s life to shape a picture of the man, set against the Scottish land he loved. Looking at both his strengths and shortcomings, Phillips does not shy away from the issues that made MacDonald a controversial figure during his life and beyond. Previously out of print, this work will be welcomed by all who have come to love the Scottish storyteller&#39;s novels and his view of God as Father.</p><p>MICHAEL PHILLIPS (b.1946), one of many in a rising generation of spiritual offspring of C.S. Lewis, George MacDonald, and the legacy of the Inklings, has made it his life&#39;s passion to promote the teachings of these giants of the past. Following the tradition of C.S. Lewis, he stands with others through the years who have shared a vision to awaken interest in the man known as the Father of the Inklings, including the names Kilby, Yates, Hein, Sadler, Reis, Robb, Amell, Triggs, Raeper, and many contributors to this important work. Through their efforts, MacDonald&#39;s legacy lives on in the lives of thousands of spiritual grandsons and granddaughters. Michael Phillips is widely known as George MacDonald&#39;s redactor, publisher, and biographer, whose vision and editorial expertise building upon the forerunning work of C.S. Lewis, Elizabeth Yates, and Rolland Hein helped bring MacDonald back from obscurity in the 1980s when his realistic novels had been nearly forgotten. Author and editor of over 100 books, Phillips efforts helped ignite the MacDonald renaissance of recent years. As one of those responsible for the widespread renewal of MacDonald&#39;s influence, Phillips is recognized as among the world&#39;s foremost purveyors of MacDonald s message, with particular insight into the Scotsman&#39;s heart and spiritual vision. Michael Phillips is considered to be one of the most versatile and prolific Christian authors of our time. To those unfamiliar with his work, the question, What kind of books does Michael Phillips write? has no easy answer. He began his distinguished writing career in 1977 with several non-fiction titles. Since that time, he has authored over twenty non-fiction books, most notably dealing with the nature and character of God and the Fatherhood of God. After turning to the writing of novels in the mid 1980s, Phillips has penned some sixty fiction titles of great variety. The enormous breadth of his faithful audience is testimony that his writings are universal in their appeal. Most of his series have been best sellers in the Christian market. In the 1970s Michael Phillips discovered the writings of Victorian Scotsman George MacDonald, whose books were foundational in leading C.S. Lewis out of atheism into Christianity. Phillips soon made it his life s work and passion to bring to public attention the literary and spiritual links between MacDonald and Lewis. If MacDonald is the father of the Inklings, Phillips calls himself one of thousands of sons of the Inklings. Inspired by the groundbreaking work of two other pioneers with similar vision to his own, authoress Elizabeth Yates and Wheaton s Dr. Rolland Hein, Phillips recognized that MacDonald s realistic fiction novels were in precarious danger of being lost to history. He knew that new publication avenues were needed. To accomplish the goal of bringing MacDonald s name back into prominence, he set about preparing and releasing updated and edited editions of MacDonald&#39;s novels, as well as republishing MacDonald s novels, sermons, and poems in their original editions. His multi-dimensional efforts resulted in a new generation of readers having access to MacDonald&#39;s books again for themselves. Phillips is also known as George MacDonald&#39;s biographer. His George MacDonald, Scotland&#39;s Beloved Storyteller, was the first major biography of MacDonald produced in the U.S. and remains one of the best selling MacDonald biographies of all time. As his own volume of work reaches a stature of significance in its own right, Phillips is regarded, like Lewis and Hein before him, as one of many successors to MacDonald&#39;s vision and spiritual legacy for a new generation.</p><h2>Fell&#39;s ESP Power</h2><p><p>Seth speaks for the first time.

As soon as the ceremony was over, he began an emergency meeting with President Bill Clinton on the financial crisis in Mexico. This was not only a harbinger of things to come during what would prove to be a rocky period in the global economy; it also captured the essence of Rubin himself--short on formality, quick to get into the nitty-gritty.<br><br>From his early years in the storied arbitrage department at Goldman Sachs to his current position as chairman of the executive committee of Citigroup, Robert Rubin has been a major figure at the center of the American financial system. He was a key player in the longest economic expansion in U.S. history. With <b>In an Uncertain World</b>, Rubin offers a shrewd, keen analysis of some of the most important events in recent American history and presents a clear, consistent approach to thinking about markets and dealing with the new risks of the global economy.<br><br>Rubin's fundamental philosophy is that nothing is provably certain. Probabilistic thinking has guided his career in both business and government. We see that discipline at work in meetings with President Clinton and Hillary Clinton, Chinese premier Zhu Rongji, Alan Greenspan, Lawrence Summers, Newt Gingrich, Sanford Weill, and the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan. We see Rubin apply it time and again while facing financial crises in Asia, Russia, and Brazil; the federal government shutdown; the rise and fall of the stock market; the challenges of the post-September 11 world; the ongoing struggle over fiscal policy; and many other momentous economic and political events.<br><br>With a compelling and candid voice and a sharp eye for detail, Rubin portrays the daily life of the White House-confronting matters both mighty and mundane--as astutely as he examines the challenges that lie ahead for the nation. Part political memoir, part prescriptive economic analysis, and part personal look at business problems, <b>In an Uncertain World</b> is a deep examination of Washington and Wall Street by a figure who for three decades has been at the center of both worlds.</p><p>"As Secretary of the Treasury, Bob Rubin ranked with the best.&nbsp; This drama-packed account of his years on the job should be read by all who are interested in what happens when politics and economics intersect."<br>-<b>Warren Buffett</b><br><br>"Robert Rubin in one of the most brilliant and honorable wise men of our era, and he has produced an extraordinary book. It is both fascinating and readable. With charming candor and a wealth of lessons, it provides an exciting account of his life on Wall Street <br>and of his tenure as the presidential adviser and Treasury Secretary. But it is also a very personal book filled with tales and insights about his relationships with such key players as Alan Greenspan, Larry Summers and President Bill Clinton. This is destined to be one of the most important books, as well as one of the most enjoyable and enlightening, published in our time."<br>-<b>Walter Isaacson</b><br><br>"Bob Rubin takes us behind the closed doors and into the nerve center of Wall Street, the White House and the Treasury Department during a historic time in the global economy. It's a fascinating and highly instructive tale told by a man who is uniquely qualified to guide us through these monumental political and economic challenges."<br>-<b>Tom Brokaw</b><br><br>"Robert Rubin served with distinction as Secretary of Treasury during a period of turbulence in international financial markets. He has now written an engrossing and thoughtful book about his experiences. Even those who do not agree with some of his conclusions, will find this important reading."<br>-<b>Henry Kissinger<br></b><br>"When historians look back on the 1990s, they will almost certainly ask how the greatest economic expansion in American history happened. Robert Rubin's forthright and fascinating memoir will be the place to begin. With the meticulousness of a scholar and an appealing lack of vanity, Rubin has written the kind of book that important figures in history should write but seldom do."<br>-<b>Michael Beschloss</b>Robert E. Rubin spent twenty-six years at Goldman Sachs, rising to co-senior partner, before becoming director of the White House National Economic Council from 1993 to 1995, and U.S. Treasury Secretary from 1995 to 1999. He is currently a director of Citigroup.

Lincoln's effort to end slavery has been controversial from its inception-when it was denounced by some as an unconstitutional usurpation and by others as an inadequate half-measure-up to the present, as historians have discounted its import and impact. At the sesquicentennial of the Emancipation Proclamation, Louis Masur seeks to restore the document's reputation by exploring its evolution.</p><p><br></p><p><br><i>Lincoln's Hundred Days</i> is the first book to tell the full story of the critical period between September 22, 1862, when Lincoln issued his preliminary Proclamation, and January 1, 1863, when he signed the final, significantly altered, decree. In those tumultuous hundred days, as battlefield deaths mounted, debate raged. Masur commands vast primary sources to portray the daily struggles and enormous consequences of the president's efforts as Lincoln led a nation through war and toward emancipation. With his deadline looming, Lincoln hesitated and calculated, frustrating friends and foes alike, as he reckoned with the anxieties and expectations of millions. We hear these concerns, from poets, cabinet members and foreign officials, from enlisted men on the front and free blacks as well as slaves.</p><p><br></p><p><br>Masur presents a fresh portrait of Lincoln as a complex figure who worried about, listened to, debated, prayed for, and even joked with his country, and then followed his conviction in directing America toward a terrifying and thrilling unknown.</p></p><p>Louis P. Masur is Distinguished Professor of American Studies and History at Rutgers University.When Lincoln published a preliminary proclamation on September 22, 1862, warning Confederate states of his intention to issue a final edict on January 1, he did not realize that those two dates stood precisely one hundred days apart. <b>Louis Masur</b>'s <i>Lincoln's Hundred Days </i>focuses on that crucial period, but it starts more than a year earlier to set the stage for those hundred days, and follows up with the aftermath and consequences of Lincoln's historic action.

Six decades after the last SS unit capitulated or was annihilated, the facts about many aspects of this organization are still shrouded in legend and half-truth. Loathed by many as a criminal organization, yet admired by some for the esprit, resolve, and valor of its component units and individuals, the Waffen-SS was unarguably a highly-complex, multi-faceted phenomenon, unique among the military organizations of the world. Marc Rikmenspoel, author of Soldiers of the Waffen-SS: Many Nations, One Motto, has crafted the ultimate reference for those trying to understand the intensely controversial and complicated nature of the Waffen-SS. A comprehensive overview that will be useful to historians, buffs, wargamers, and re-enactors alike, no matter what your predisposition to the Waffen-SS, you will learn a great deal from this book. The book includes a concise history of every one of the major fighting formations of the Waffen-SS (those designated as &#34;divisions&#34;). Sections include: * Formations * Structure of Divisions * Germans * Germanics * Non-Germans and Non-Germanics * Leading Personalities * Weapons * Misconceptions and Controversies * Weapons Tables</p><p></p><h2>Lassoed in Texas Trilogy</h2><p><p>Enjoy the pleasure of owning Mary Connealy&#x2019;s complete Lassoed in Texas series all under one cover.

Its title, <i>Afterimages</i>, alludes to the dislocation of time that runs through many of the films and works Mulvey interrogates and influences the way we view them. Structured in three main parts, the book begins with a section on the theme of woman as spectacle and continues with a focus on films drawn from different parts of the world but directed by women and about women, and all adopting radical cinematic strategies. She concludes with analyses of moving image works made for art galleries, arguing that the aesthetics of cinema have persisted into this environment. <i>Afterimages</i> also features an appendix of ten frequently asked questions on Mulvey&#x2019;s classic feminist essay &#x201c;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,&#x201d; in which Mulvey addresses questions of spectatorship crucial to our era of #MeToo.

In the chapters that follow I will do my best to provide answers for the curious, reassurance for the anxious, and unexpected facts for the deceived.</p> <p>It won&#x2019;t be easy, and I begin with a simple premise: everything you think you know about flying is wrong. That&#x2019;s an exaggeration, I hope, but not an outrageous starting point in light of what I&#x2019;m up against. Commercial aviation is a breeding ground for bad information, and the extent to which different myths, fallacies, and conspiracy theories have become embedded in the prevailing wisdom is startling. Even the savviest frequent flyers are prone to misconstruing much of what actually goes on.</p> <p>It isn&#x2019;t surprising. Air travel is a complicated, inconvenient, and often scary affair for millions of people, and at the same time it&#x2019;s cloaked in secrecy. Its mysteries are concealed behind a wall of specialized jargon, corporate reticence, and an irresponsible media. Airlines, it hardly needs saying, aren&#x2019;t the most forthcoming of entities, while journalists and broadcasters like to keep it simple and sensational. It&#x2019;s hard to know who to trust or what to believe.</p> <p>I&#x2019;ll give it my best shot. And in doing so, I will tell you how a plane stays in the air, yes. I&#x2019;ll address your nuts-and-bolts concerns and tackle those insufferable myths. However, this is not a book about flying, per se. I will not burden readers with gee-whiz specifications about airplanes. I am not writing for gearheads or those with a predisposed interest in planes; my readers don&#x2019;t want to see an aerospace engineer&#x2019;s schematic of a jet engine, and a technical discussion about cockpit instruments or aircraft hydraulics is guaranteed to be tedious and uninteresting&#x2015;especially to me. Sure, we&#x2019;re all curious how fast a plane goes, how high it flies, how many statistical bullet points can be made of its wires and plumbing. But as both author and pilot, my infatuation with flight goes beyond the airplane itself, encompassing the fuller, richer drama of getting from here to there&#x2015;the &#x201c;theater&#x201d; of air travel, as I like to call it.</p> <p>For most of us who grow up to become airline pilots, flying isn&#x2019;t just something we fell into after college. Ask any pilot where his love of aviation comes from, and the answer almost always goes back to early childhood&#x2015;to some ineffable, hard-wired affinity. Mine certainly did. My earliest crayon drawings were of planes, and I took flying lessons before I could drive. Just the same, I have never met another pilot whose formative obsessions were quite like mine. I have limited fascination with the sky or with the seat-of-the-pants thrills of flight itself. As a youngster, the sight of a Piper Cub meant nothing to me. Five minutes at an air show watching the Blue Angels do barrel rolls, and I was bored to tears. What enthralled me instead were the workings of the airlines: the planes they flew and the places they went.</p> <p>In the fifth grade I could recognize a Boeing 727-100 from a 727-200 by the shape of the intake of its center engine (oval, not round). I could spend hours cloistered in my bedroom or at the dining room table, poring over the route maps and timetables of Pan Am, Aeroflot, Lufthansa, and British Airways, memorizing the names of the foreign capitals they flew to. Next time you&#x2019;re wedged in economy, flip to the route maps in the back of the inflight magazine. I could spend hours studying those three-panel foldouts and their crazy nests of city-pairs, immersed in a kind of junior pilot porno. I knew the logos and liveries of all the prominent airlines (and many of the nonprominent ones) and could replicate them freehand with a set of colored pencils.</p> <p>Thus I learned geography as thoroughly as I learned aviation. For most pilots, the world beneath those lines of the route map remains a permanent abstraction, countries and cultures of little or no interest beyond the airport fence or the perimeter of the layover hotel. For others, as happened to me, there&#x2019;s a point when those places become meaningful. One feels an excitement not merely from the act of moving through the air, but from the idea of going somewhere. You&#x2019;re not just flying, you&#x2019;re traveling. The full, beautiful integration of flight and travel, travel and flight. Are they not the same thing? To me they are. One can inspire the other, sure, but I never would have traipsed off to so many countries in my free time&#x2015;from Cambodia to Botswana, Sri Lanka to Brunei&#x2015;if I hadn&#x2019;t fallen in love with aviation first.</p> <p>If ever this connection struck me in a moment of clarity, it was a night several years ago during a vacation to Mali, in West Africa. Though I could write pages about the wonders and strangeness of West Africa, one of the trip&#x2019;s most vivid moments took place at the airport in Bamako, moments after our plane touched down from Paris. Two hundred of us descended the drive-up stairs into a sinister midnight murk. The air was misty and smelled of woodsmoke. Yellow beams from military-style spotlights crisscrossed the tarmac. We were paraded solemnly around the exterior of the aircraft, moving aft in a wide semicircle toward the arrivals lounge. There was something ceremonial and ritualistic about it. I remember walking beneath the soaring, blue-and-white tail of Air France, the plane&#x2019;s auxiliary turbine screaming into the darkness. It was all so exciting and, to use a politically incorrect word, exotic. And that incredible airplane is what brought us there. In a matter of hours, no less&#x2015;a voyage that once would have taken weeks by ship and desert caravan.</p> <p>The disconnect between air travel and culture seems to me wholly unnatural, yet we&#x2019;ve seen a virtually clean break. Nobody gives a damn anymore how you get there&#x2015;the means coldly separated from the ends. For most people, whether bound for Kansas or Kathmandu, the airplane is a necessary evil, incidental to the journey but no longer part of it. An old girlfriend of mine, an artist who would have no trouble appreciating the play of light in a seventeenth-century painting by Vermeer, found my opinions utterly perplexing. Like most people, she analogized airplanes merely as tools. The sky was the canvas, she believed; the jetliner as discardable as the painter&#x2019;s brush. I disagree, for as a brush&#x2019;s stroke represents the moment of artistic inspiration, what is travel without the journey?</p> <p>We&#x2019;ve come to view flying as yet another impressive but ultimately uninspiring technological realm. There I am, sitting in a Boeing 747, a plane that if tipped onto its nose would rise as tall as a 20-story office tower. I&#x2019;m at 33,000 feet over the Pacific Ocean, traveling at 600 miles per hour, bound for the Far East. And what are the passengers doing? Complaining, sulking, tapping glumly into their laptops. A man next to me is upset over a dent in his can of ginger ale. This is the realization, perhaps, of a fully evolved technology. Progress, one way or the other, mandates that the extraordinary become the ordinary. But don&#x2019;t we lose valuable perspective when we begin to equate the commonplace, more or less by definition, with the tedious? Aren&#x2019;t we forfeiting something important when we sneer indifferently at the sight of an airplane&#x2015;at the sheer impressiveness of being able to throw down a few hundred dollars and travel halfway around the world at nearly the speed of sound? It&#x2019;s a tough sell, I know, in this age of long lines, grinding delays, overbooked planes, and inconsolable babies. To be clear, I am not extolling the virtues of tiny seats or the culinary subtlety of half-ounce bags of snack mix. The indignities and hassles of modern air travel require little elaboration and are duly noted. But believe it or not, there is still plenty about flying for the traveler to savor and appreciate.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m hesitant to say that we&#x2019;ve developed a sense of entitlement, but it&#x2019;s something like that. Our technological triumphs aside, consider also the industry&#x2019;s remarkable safety record and the fact that fares have remained startlingly cheap, even with tremendous surges in the price of fuel. Sure, years ago, passengers could enjoy a five-course meal served by a tuxedoed flight attendant before retiring to a private sleeping berth. My first airplane ride was in 1974: I remember my father in a suit and tie and double helpings of fresh cheesecake on a ninety-minute domestic flight. The thing was, getting on a plane was expensive. This will be lost on many people today, young people especially, but once upon a time, college kids didn&#x2019;t zip home for a few days over Christmas. You didn&#x2019;t grab a last minute seat for $99 and pop over to Las Vegas&#x2015;or to Mallorca or Phuket&#x2015;for a long weekend. Flying was a luxury, and people indulged sporadically, if at all. In 1939, aboard Pan Am&#x2019;s Dixie Clipper, it cost $750 to fly round-trip between New York and France. That&#x2019;s equal to well over $11,000 in today&#x2019;s money. In 1970, it cost the equivalent of $2,700 to fly from New York to Hawaii.</p> <p>Things changed. Planes, for one, became more efficient. Aircraft like the 707 and the 747 made long-haul travel affordable to the masses. Then the effects of deregulation kicked in, changing forever the way airlines competed. Fares plummeted, and passengers poured in. Yes, flying became more aggravating and less comfortable. It also became affordable for almost everybody.</p> <p>I have learned never to underestimate the contempt people hold for airlines and the degree to which they hate to fly. While some of this contempt is well deserved, much of it is unfair. Today a passenger can, in a backpack and flip-flops, traverse the oceans for the equivalent of a few pennies per mile, in near-perfect safety and with an 85 percent chance of arriving on time. Is that really such an awful way to travel? Meanwhile, if you&#x2019;re that insatiably eager to revisit those luxurious indulgences of aviation&#x2019;s golden years, well, you can do that too, by purchasing a first or business class ticket&#x2015;for less than what it cost fifty years ago. </p></p><h2>Ireland: A Short History (Short Histories)</h2><p>This third edition of Joseph Coohill&#x2019;s bestselling book has been fully updated to include all the latest political developments in Ireland.

He died in December 2011.</p>Gods of Our Fathers: The United<br>States of Enlightenment <br>&nbsp;<br>Why should we care what the Founding Fathers believed, or did not believe, about religion? They went to such great trouble to insulate faith from politics, and took such care to keep their own convictions private, that it would scarcely matter if it could now be proved that, say, George Washington was a secret Baptist. The ancestor of the American Revolution was the English Revolution of the 1640s, whose leaders and spokesmen were certainly Protestant fundamentalists, but that did not bind the Framers and cannot be said to bind us, either. Indeed, the established Protestant church in Britain was one of the models which we can be quite sure the signatories of 1776 were determined to avoid emulating.<br>&nbsp;<br>Moreover, the eighteenth-century scholars and gentlemen who gave us the U.S. Constitution were in a relative state of innocence respecting knowledge of the cosmos, the Earth, and the psyche, of the sort that has revolutionized the modern argument over faith. Charles Darwin was born in Thomas Jefferson&#x2019;s lifetime (on the very same day as Abraham Lincoln, as it happens), but Jefferson&#x2019;s guesses about the fossils found in Virginia were to Darwinism what alchemy is to chemistry. And the insights of Einstein and Freud lay over a still more distant horizon. The furthest that most skeptics could go was in the direction of an indeterminate deism, which accepted that the natural order seemed to require a designer but did not necessitate the belief that the said designer actually intervened in human affairs. Invocations such as &#x201c;nature&#x2019;s god&#x201d; were partly intended to hedge this bet, while avoiding giving offense to the pious. Even Thomas Paine, the most explicitly anti-Christian of the lot, wrote <i>The Age of Reason </i>as a defense of god from those who traduced him in man-made screeds like the Bible.<br>&nbsp;<br>Considering these limitations, it is quite astonishing how irreligious the Founders actually were. You might not easily guess, for example, who was the author of the following words:<br>&nbsp;<br>Oh! Lord! Do you think that a Protestant Popedom is annihilated in America? Do you recollect, or have you ever attended to the ecclesiastical Strifes in Maryland Pensilvania [sic], New York, and every part of New England? What a mercy it is that these People cannot whip and crop, and pillory and roast, as yet in the U.S.! If they could they would. . . . There is a germ of religion in human nature so strong that whenever an order of men can persuade the people by flattery or terror that they have salvation at their disposal, there can be no end to fraud, violence, or usurpation.<br>&nbsp;<br>That was John Adams, in relatively mild form. He was also to point out, though without too much optimism, the secret weapon that secularists had at their disposal&#x2014;namely the profusion of different religious factions:<br>&nbsp;<br>The multitude and diversity of them, You will say, is our Security against them all. God grant it. But if We consider that the Presbyterians and Methodists are far the most numerous and the most likely to unite; let a George Whitefield arise, with a military cast, like Mahomet, or Loyola, and what will become of all the other Sects who can never unite?<br>&nbsp;<br>George Whitefield was the charismatic preacher who is so superbly mocked in Benjamin Franklin&#x2019;s <i>Autobiography</i>. Of Franklin it seems almost certainly right to say that he was an atheist (Jerry Weinberger&#x2019;s excellent recent study <i>Benjamin Franklin Unmasked </i>being the best reference here), but the master tacticians of church-state separation, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, were somewhat more opaque about their beliefs. In passing the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom&#x2014;the basis of the later First Amendment&#x2014;they brilliantly exploited the fear that each Christian sect had of persecution by the others. It was easier to get the squabbling factions to agree on no tithes than it would have been to get them to agree on tithes that might also benefit their doctrinal rivals. In his famous &#x201c;wall of separation&#x201d; letter, assuring the Baptists of Danbury, Connecticut, of their freedom from persecution, Jefferson was responding to the expressed fear of this little community that they would be oppressed by&#x2014;the Congregationalists of Connecticut.<br>&nbsp;<br>This same divide-and-rule tactic may have won him the election of 1800 that made him president in the first place. In the face of a hysterical Federalist campaign to blacken Jefferson as an infidel, the Voltaire of Monticello appealed directly to those who feared the arrogance of the Presbyterians. Adams himself thought that this had done the trick.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;With the Baptists, Quakers, Methodists, and Moravians,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;as well as the Dutch and German Lutherans and Calvinists, it had an immense effect, and turned them in such numbers as decided the election. They said, let us have an Atheist or Deist or any thing rather than an establishment of Presbyterianism.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>The essential point&#x2014;that a religiously neutral state is the chief guarantee of religious pluralism&#x2014;is the one that some of today&#x2019;s would-be theocrats are determined to miss. Brooke Allen misses no chance to rub it in, sometimes rather heavily stressing contemporary &#x201c;faith-based&#x201d; analogies. She is especially interesting on the extent to which the Founders felt obliged to keep their doubts on religion to themselves. Madison, for example, did not find himself able, during the War of 1812, to refuse demands for a national day of prayer and fasting. But he confided his own reservations to his private papers, published as &#x201c;Detached Memoranda&#x201d; only in 1946. It was in those pages, too, that he expressed the view that to have chaplains opening Congress, or chaplains in the armed forces, was unconstitutional.</p><h2>A Rebel War Clerk&#39;s Diary at the Confederate States Capital: Vol 2 (Collector&#39;s Library of the Civil War)</h2><p>A Rebel war clerk&#39;s diary at the Confederate States capital - Vol. 2 Gale Archival Editions: On Demand are digital copies of rare and out-of-print historical content.

Last evening she had been out in her beloved garden, digging round the young plants; then as it was going dark she had found a disgruntled hedgehog and had played with him, trying to persuade him to take some bread and milk, and had only come in reluctantly as the sky clouded and it went cold.</p> <p>This now-this thing in the middle of the night-might yet be only the result of getting overtired.</p> <p>But when it began to feel as if someone was kneeling on her backbone and trying to break it, she knew it was not.</p> <p>She touched Ross's arm and he woke instantly.</p> <p>"Well?"</p> <p>"I think," she said, "I think you will have to fetch Prudie."</p> <p>He sat up. "Why? What is it?"</p> <p>"I have a pain."</p> <p>"Where? Do you mean..."</p> <p>"I have a pain," she said primly. "I think twould be as well to fetch Prudie."</p> <p>He climbed quickly out of bed, and she listened to the scratch of flint and steel. After a moment the tinder caught and he lit a candle. The room flickered into view: heavy teak beams, the curtain over the door moving gently in the breeze, the low window seat hung with pink grogram, her shoes as she had kicked them off, one wooden sole upmost, Joshua's spyglass, Ross's pipe, Ross's book, and a fly crawling.</p> <p>He looked at her and at once knew the truth. She smiled a pallid apology. He went across to the table by the door and poured her a glass of brandy.</p> <p>"Drink this. I will send Jud for Dr. Choake." He began to pull on his clothes, anyhow.</p> <p>"No, no, Ross; do not send yet. It is the middle of the night. He will be asleep."</p> <p>Whether Thomas Choake should be called in to her had been a dissension between them for some weeks. Demelza could not forget that twelve months ago she had been a maidservant and that Choake, though only a physician, owned a small estate which, even if it had been bought with his wife's money, put him on a level from which the likes of her would be seen as unimportant chattels. That was until Ross married her. Since then she had grown to her position. She could put on a show of refinement and good manners, and not at all a bad show at that, but a doctor was different. A doctor caught one at a disadvantage. If the pain was bad, she would almost certainly swear in the old way she had learned from her father, not a few genteel "damn mes" and "by Gods," as anyone might excuse from a lady in trouble. To have a baby and be forced to act genteel at the same time was more than Demelza could look forward to.</p> <p>Besides, she didn't want a man about. It wasn't decent. Her cousin-in-law, Elizabeth, had had him, but Elizabeth was an aristocrat born and bred, and they looked at things different. <i>She </i>would far rather have had old Aunt Betsy Triggs from Mellin, who sold pilchards and was a rare strong hand when it came to babies.</p> <p>But Ross was the more determined and he had had his way. She was not unprepared for his curt, "Then he shall be woke," as he left the room.</p> <p><i>"Ross!" </i>She called him back. For the moment the pain had gone.</p> <p>"Yes?" His strong, scarred, introspective face was half lit by the candle; the upgrowing dark hair was ruffled and hardly showed its hint of copper; his shirt was open at the throat. This man...aristocrat of them all, she thought...this man, so reserved and reserving, with whom she had shared rare intimacy.</p> <p>"Would you?" she said. "Before you go..."</p> <p>He came back to the bed. The emergency had come on him so quickly in his sleep that he had had no time yet to feel anything but alarm that her time was here and relief that it might soon be over. As he kissed her he saw the moisture on her face and a worm of fear and compassion moved in him. He took her face in his hands, pushed back the black hair, and stared a moment into the dark eyes of his young wife. They were not dancing and mischievous as they so often were, but there was no fear in them.</p> <p>"I'll be back. In a moment I'll be back."</p> <p>She made a gesture of dissent. "Don't come back, Ross. Go and tell Prudie, that's all. I'd rather-you didn't see me like this."</p> <p>"And what of Verity? You specially wanted Verity here."</p> <p>"Tell her in the morning. Tisn't fair to bring her out in the night air. Send for her in the morning."</p> <p>He kissed her again.</p> <p>"Tell me that you love me, Ross," she said.</p> <p>He looked at her in surprise.</p> <p>"You know I do!"</p> <p>"And say you don't love Elizabeth."</p> <p>"And I don't love Elizabeth." What else was he to say when he did not know the truth himself? He was not a man who spoke his inmost feelings easily, but now he saw himself powerless to help her, and only words of his and not actions would give her aid. "Nothing else matters but you," he said. "Remember that. All my relatives and friends-and Elizabeth, and this house and the mine...I'd throw them in the dust and you know it-and you know it. If you don't know it, then all these months I've failed and no words I can give you now will make it otherwise. I love you, Demelza, and we've had such happiness. And we're going to have it again. Take hold of that, my sweet. Hold it and keep it, for no one else can."</p> <p>"I'll hold it, Ross," she said, content because the words had come.</p> <p>He kissed her again and turned and lit more candles, took up one, and went quickly out of the room, the hot grease running over his hand. The wind had dropped since yesterday; there was only a breeze. He did not know the time, but it felt about two.</p> <p>He pushed open the door on the other side of the landing and went across to the bedroom where Jud and Prudie slept. The ill-fitting bedroom door opened with a long squeak, which merged into Prudie's slow rasping snore. He grunted in disgust, for the hot, close, sweaty smell offended his nose. The night air might be dangerous, but they could surely open the window during the day and let this stink out.</p> <p>He went across and parted the curtains and shook Jud by the shoulders. Jud's two great teeth showed like gravestones. He shook again, violently. Jud's nightcap came off and a spot of the candle grease fell on his bald patch. Jud woke. He began to curse; then he saw who it was and sat up rubbing his head.</p> <p>"What's amiss?"</p> <p>"Demelza is ill." How call her anything but Demelza to a man who had been here when she came as a tattered waif of thirteen? "I want you to go for Dr. Choake at once. And wake Prudie. She will be wanted too."</p> <p>"What's amiss with her?"</p> <p>"Her pains have begun." </p></p><h2>Rewired: The Post-Cyberpunk Anthology</h2><p>Cyberpunk is dead.

He teaches courses in science fiction, fantasy, and fiction writing at North Carolina State University. His criticism has appeared in Foundation, the <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i>, the <i>New York Review of Science Fiction</i>, and <i>Science Fiction Age</i>.Arranged loosely in order of publication, the 16 diverse selections in this decade-spanning anthology add up to a plausible snapshot of cyberpunk's short-form evolution. Kelly and Kessel (<i>Feeling Very Strange</i>) clearly describe cyberpunk counterculture in a cogent introduction, yet draw only one story from a nongenre source (Greg Egan's Yeyuka) and greatly undervalue the subgenre's ability, at its most popular, to reach beyond SF's core audience. While some entries (Charles Stross's Lobsters; Cory Doctorow's When Sysadmins Ruled the Earth) focus strongly on techno-geek culture, others apply high-tech ideas in more down-to-earth contexts (Mary Rosenblum's Search Engine; Paolo Bacigalupi's The Calorie Man). The critical matter is too scant for academic readers and too intrusive for genre fans; discussion of specific stories is extremely sparse, and excerpts from correspondence between Kessel and Bruce Sterling distract rather than enlighten. Readers seeking a thorough critical study should look elsewhere, but those looking for well-told stories will be satisfied. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Vann Woodward's The Burden of Southern History remains one of the essential history texts of our time. In it Woodward brilliantly addresses the interrelated themes of southern identity, southern distinctiveness, and the strains of irony that characterize much of the South's historical experience. First published in 1960, the book quickly became a touchstone for generations of students. This updated third edition contains a chapter, "Look Away, Look Away," in which Woodward finds a plethora of additional ironies in the South's experience. It also includes previously uncollected appreciations of Robert Penn Warren, to whom the book was originally dedicated, and William Faulkner. This edition also features a new foreword by historian William E. Leuchtenburg in which he recounts the events that led up to Woodward's writing The Burden of Southern History, and reflects on the book's -- and Woodward's -- place in the study of southern history. The Burden of Southern History is quintessential Woodward -- wise, witty, ruminative, daring, and as alive in the twenty-first century as when it was written.</p></p><p><p>C. Vann Woodward (1908--1999) was Sterling Professor of History Emeritus at Yale University, where he taught from 1961 until 1977. One of the leading historians of the century, Woodward wrote several books about the American South, his main field of interest. He edited Mary Chesnut's Civil War, for which he received the 1982 Pulitzer Prize for history. His other major works include Tom Watson: Agrarian Rebel; American Counterpoint; The Strange Career of Jim Crow; Reunion and Reaction; Thinking Back: The Perils of Writing History; and Origins of the New South, 1877--1913, for which he received the Bancroft Prize. He served as president of the Southern Historical Association, the Organization of American Historians, and the American Historical Association, and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. <br>William E. Leuchtenburg is William Rand Kenan, Jr., Professor Emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the author of more than a doezen books on twentieth-century American history, including The White House Looks South: Franklin D.

A former contributing editor at The Atlantic Monthly, commentator for National Public Radio&#39;s All Things Considered, and columnist for The Washington Post, Ward originated and cowrote a documentary about the Jubilee Singers for WGBH&#39;s The American Experience. He lives with his wife in Seattle, Washington.A bittersweet and movingly told story of the African-American singers who introduced Negro spirituals to audiences in the US and Europe to raise money for their alma mater, experiencing great triumphs and humiliating prejudice in the process. Ward (Our Bones are Scattered, not reviewed) begins the story in Nashville, Tennessee, as the Civil War ends and hundreds of freed slaves flock to the city. While rival church groups worked to establish schools, Ward concentrates on the institute founded by the America Missionary Association. Named after General Fisk, the head of the local Freedmen's Bureau, it eventually became known as Fisk University. By 1871, with Fisk deeply in debt and facing possible closure, George White, a devout abolitionist and music lover, decided that Fisk's only hope was for him to take a group of his nine best singers, men and women, on the road to raise money. Singing Negro spirituals, still unfamiliar to many in the North, they performed in halls and churches from Ohio to Massachusetts. Emboldened by their success but still needing money, White then took the group abroad. Ward vividly details their three lengthy tours that included visits to England (where they were guests of William Gladstone and sang for Queen Victoria) and Europe (where they performed for the Dutch and German royalty). They raised more that $150,000 (the equivalent of $2.5 million today), but it was at a cost: White was worn out, his successors over-programmed the singers, the singers quarreled (and some left), and in the US they had to endure abuse, stay in inferior lodgings, and travel in segregated trains. But their songs were embraced by a whole new audience, moved by the melodies and words of hope. Very readable history of a forgotten period and a group that saved their school and taught the world to sing their songs. -- <i>Copyright �2000, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In this masterful dual biography, award-winning Harvard University scholar John Stauffer describes the transformations in the lives of these two giants during a major shift in cultural history, when men rejected the status quo and embraced new ideals of personal liberty. As Douglass and Lincoln reinvented themselves and ultimately became friends, they transformed America.<br> Lincoln was born dirt poor, had less than one year of formal schooling, and became the nation's greatest president. Douglass spent the first twenty years of his life as a slave, had no formal schooling-in fact, his masters forbade him to read or write-and became one of the nation's greatest writers and activists, as well as a spellbinding orator and messenger of audacious hope, the pioneer who blazed the path traveled by future African-American leaders.<br> At a time when most whites would not let a black man cross their threshold, Lincoln invited Douglass into the White House. Lincoln recognized that he needed Douglass to help him destroy the Confederacy and preserve the Union; Douglass realized that Lincoln's shrewd sense of public opinion would serve his own goal of freeing the nation's blacks. Their relationship shifted in response to the country's debate over slavery, abolition, and emancipation.<br> Both were ambitious men. They had great faith in the moral and technological progress of their nation. And they were not always consistent in their views. John Stauffer describes their personal and political struggles with a keen understanding of the dilemmas Douglass and Lincoln confronted and the social context in which they occurred. What emerges is a brilliant portrait of how two of America's greatest leaders lived.</p><p><strong>John Stauffer</strong> is Professor of English and American Literature and Language at Harvard University. His first book, <em>The Black Hearts of Men: Radical Abolitionists and the Transformation of Race</em> (Harvard University Press, 2002), was the co-winner of the 2002 Frederick Douglass Book Prize from the Gilder Lehrman Institue; winner of the Avery Craven Book Prize from the OAH; and the Lincoln Prize runner-up. Other works include: <em>Meteor of War: The John Brown Story</em> (with Zoe Trodd, 2004); Frederick Douglass' <em>My Bondage and My Freedom</em> (editor, 2003)."John Stauffer's <strong>GIANTS is a lyrical, insightful treatment of the fascinating relationship between two geniuses</strong>, one a politician and the other a radical reformer. Both Lincoln and Douglass heard the music of words in their heads as few others, and Stauffer has an ear for the two of them in harmony. That they started in such different places ideologically and yet moved together at the critical moment of emancipation makes this <strong>a timely and important book. </strong> <strong>Stauffer brings the tools of literature and history to bear on this comparison with unmatched skill.</strong>" (<b>David W. Blight, Yale University, author of Frederick Douglass' Civil War and A Slave No More</b>)<br><br>"<strong>In this stunning book, John Stauffer has given us the most insightful portrait of either Lincoln or Douglass in years.</strong> In graceful prose, he tells a moving story of the two men who dominated Nineteenth century American life -- as allies across the racial divide, friends who drew common inspiration from hard scrabble beginnings and a love of language, and fellow travelers on the road of American self-making. <strong>Giants is simply must reading!</strong>" (<b>Richard S. Newman, author of Freedom's Prophet: Bishop Richard Allen, the AME Church, and the Black Founding Fathers</b>)<br><br>Like a daguerreotype, which nineteenth-century Americans thought captured not simply surface appearances, but peoples' souls, this book moves beyond biography to allow us to recover the inner lives of two utterly uncommon common men. <strong>This is the most insightful book about race and friendship in the nineteenth century that I have read. It's poignant and perceptive, a book to be savored, a book that will last</strong>. (<b>Steven Mintz, Columbia University, author of America and Its Peoples: A Mosaic in the Making</b>)<br><br>"John Stauffer's collective biography of Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln <strong>stands apart from other biographies</strong> by focusing on how each man continually remade himself, with help from women, words, self-education, physical strength, and luck. In the process Stauffer gives us the texture and feel--a "thick description"--of the strange worlds that Douglass and Lincoln inhabited. The result is <strong>a path-breaking work that dissolves traditional conceptions of these two seminal figures</strong> (Lincoln the "redeemer" president, Douglass the assimilationist). He reveals how Douglass towered over Lincoln as a brilliant orator, writer, agitator, and public figure for most of his life. He shows us how words became potent weapons for both men. And <strong>he tells the poignant story of how these preeminent self-made men ultimately converged, despite their vastly different agendas and politics, and helped transform the nation.</strong>" (<b>Henry Louis Gates, Jr., Harvard University, author of The African American Century: How Black Americans Have Shaped Our Century</b>)</p><h2>The Impenetrable Forest: My Gorilla Years in Uganda, Revised Edition</h2><p>A self-described eco-nerd Thor Hanson, scientist and writer, brought the nascent gorilla tourist program in Bwindi National Park, located within Africa&#39;s Impenetrable Forest, to life.

They talk about relationships being a tandem climb, where the partners swap leads for a lifetime. I love that metaphor&#x2014;Tim and I on a tandem climb. That&#x2019;s so what I dream about.<br><br>And like all good Buddhists, Stephen and Ondrea (I like to use their first names &#x2019;cause I feel like I know them) met in silent retreat&#x2014;a death-and-dying workshop, no less. Ondrea had been battling a series of diseases for a lifetime and Stephen was a teacher of Conscious Dying. And Buddhists are the bomb as far as death-and-dying stuff goes. Ask anybody. Anyway, they met, they fell in love at this silent retreat. The first day, before dropping into unabating silence, they went around that classic circle, sharing the &#x201c;what brings you here&#x201d; talk. After the talk, Ondrea headed back to her tent, where someone had left a note on her pillow that said: &#x201c;I love you and would like to take care of you and your child for the rest of your life.&#x201d; And Ondrea instantly knew who had written that note.<br><br>And the rest writes itself. The silent retreat culminates with a Sufi dance&#x2014;because if you were a death-and-dying silent retreat, wouldn&#x2019;t you end that way too? A wild spinning dervish sending you straight into ecstatic trance? And mid-dance, their eyes locked and they danced away from that Sufi circle together and have never left each other since. And as any Buddhist Cinderella story should go, both had made peace with being alone indefinitely, each imagining themselves odd enough nuts to never run into somebody else as odd as they. And let&#x2019;s be honest, how big is that death-and-dying dating pool anyway? And as soon as their kids were out of the house, they decided to take relationship as spiritual practice up a notch or two, living in retreat only with each other in New Mexico. (Maybe that&#x2019;s what my parents should have done. Or what Tim and I should do now, when we&#x2019;re just getting started.) But Stephen and Ondrea simply taught what they learned. And you know, typically, Buddhist monks aren&#x2019;t the best advisors to couplehoods. So, for long-term couple stuff, give me Stephen. Give me Ondrea.<br><br>.75<br><br>Steven and Ondrea Telephone Readings<br><br>Purpose: One step further. To study and discuss the book with what I call my Designated Spiritual Friend, Denise.<br><br>Duration: These can last hours.<br><br>Equipment Needed: Two phones.<br><br>Age: 30.<br><br>Cost: Free.<br><br>Location: Bellingham, Washington (me), and Wyoming (Denise).<br><br>Denise and I are on the phone yet again, reading aloud from Embracing the Beloved. It&#x2019;s dark outside. I sit in Tim&#x2019;s and my new (old) house, largely empty, minus a bed and a dresser or two. We&#x2019;re still moving in and don&#x2019;t own much furniture.<br><br>Tonight, I wait for Tim to return from a business trip to Colorado. He&#x2019;s helping some organizations get on their feet. Tim and I met in Patagonia, on a semester-length wilderness training program I took after graduating from Columbia. I had waited tables at a Berkeley, California, microbrew pub and saved all my tips for the tuition in a pretty white box I hid in my pantry. It was worth every penny. I fell for not only the wilds of Patagonia but my first real love. Tim is kind (and not just average kind; like, exceptionally kind) and handsome (not just regular handsome, but this humble-shy-strong-tall-perfectly-coiffed-with-a-hint-of-disheveled-sun-bleached-blond-haired-all-American-meets-aquamarine-blue-eyes kind of handsome) and not just regular smart, but Ivy-League-got-accepted-everywhere-he-applied smart; and not just polite, but sweet-old-school-New-England-beyond-gracious polite. He&#x2019;s the most grounded, generous man I&#x2019;ve ever met. We once played that game Would You Ever and the question was, &#x201c;If you could save an endangered species by spending a year immobilized in a full-body cast, would you?&#x201d; Not only was his yes emphatic, I thought we might soon be shopping for splints, plaster, and bandages. And he&#x2019;s kind of a late bloomer, like I am. We&#x2019;ve followed each other around ever since&#x2014;from Chile to graduate school.<br><br>And here we are, five years in and newly wedded, fresh off the glow of crunchy-modern-hippie-wedding-in-the-tall-grasses-at-the-edge-of-the-wild-Similkameen-River, where we said our (of course) handwritten vows, barefoot and bathed in Mary Oliver (his) and Pablo Neruda (mine)&#x2014;all hay bales, riparian, and Northwest-y&#x2014;surrounded by our friends and parents and respective older sisters.<br><br>But tonight, while I wait for Tim in our little saltbox house, Denise and I do what we do frequently: examine our relationships as if the men in our lives are mere case studies rather than actual human beings. We&#x2019;ll often violate any confidence in the couplehood if we confidantes think it will help us get to the bottom of it. It. We analyze our men, dissect them, hoping to make sense of this life stuff, this love stuff. Never realizing that this, too, can take us further from our partners, turning them into objects. But we pat ourselves on the back and call this intimacy, as if talking about it is the same thing as doing it.<br><br>So Denise and I are deep into hour two of our little impromptu intimacy phone workshop. I read my favorite bit:<br><br>The distance from your pain, your grief, your unattended wounds, is the distance from your partner. Whatever maintains that distance, that separation from ourselves and our beloveds, must be investigated with mercy and awareness.<br><br>The mind creates the abyss but the heart crosses it.<br><br>&#x201c;God, that&#x2019;s brilliant,&#x201d; I say. I&#x2019;m sure I tear up. &#x201c;So the less afraid I am of my own pain, the closer I&#x2019;ll feel to Tim. I love that idea that the heart crosses the abyss our minds create. God, that&#x2019;s good. And I love that word beloved. I want to start using it: my beloved.&#x201d;<br><br>And so it goes. We cry over how gorgeous it is, how sensitive and deep and misunderstood we are, and, in turn, how much we misunderstand our partners; we say our I love yous and hang up. The world&#x2019;s problems nearly solved on the phone tonight. Maybe tomorrow we&#x2019;ll redraft the Palestinian peace accord.<br><br>I expected Tim home by nine p.m. Now it is ten. Then eleven. Then twelve. I start pacing our dark house in loops. This isn&#x2019;t like Tim to be late, let alone not call. To keep myself occupied, I watch Jay Leno interview Hugh Grant. The last time I saw him on the show it was following his arrest for getting a blow job from a prostitute with an exotic name. And everybody asked, &#x201c;Why in the world would someone want to get a blow job from Divine Brown, when he had Elizabeth Hurley at home?&#x201d;<br><br>And now it&#x2019;s after one a.m. and I get a phone call from Tim. He tells me he is in jail.<br><br>&#x201c;As in jail jail?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Jail,&#x201d; he repeats. &#x201c;I was on my way home on I-5 and saw a woman stumbling by the side of the road near our turnoff. I stopped and offered to let her use my phone. But then the police saw me and thought the whole thing looked suspicious and I got arrested.&#x201d;<br><br>And I think: Helping a woman stumbling? With him, possible.<br><br>&#x201c;Tim, are you telling me the truth? Because you know you can tell me the truth. I can take it.&#x201d; I speak calmly and clearly. I mean it.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;m telling you the truth,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>I offer to start making calls for assistance and attorney friends. We&#x2019;re nothing if not annoyingly overeducated with similarly annoyingly (but loving) overeducated friends. But Tim refuses the help.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be fine. I am fine. Don&#x2019;t do anything,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>&#x201c;But how will you get out? Is this your one phone call? Do you get another phone call? Or is that just the movies . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I&#x2019;ll be fine. I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d; His voice, firm.<br><br>I make those calls to trusted lawyer friends anyway. I call my mother too. Despite it being the middle of the night, I know she will answer and can snap to full consciousness on a dime, no matter how deep her sleep. I need to help, and harness more help where I can. My mom adores Tim. She will help me think this through.<br><br>When Tim and I hang up, I head straight to the bathroom. Without going into too much detail, turns out there&#x2019;s some truth to the expression &#x201c;having the shit scared out of you.&#x201d; I spend an impressive amount of time there over the next seven hours. I keep thinking about Embracing the Beloved. I pace our nearly lampless furniture-free house through the night, hoping the phone will ring again. It doesn&#x2019;t. After dawn, I get a call from a strange female voice that tells me I can pick Tim up at the jail in an hour. I put together a goodie bag of sorts, with a snack and a warm wet towel so he can wash up.<br><br>When we imagine the geography of our cities, we don&#x2019;t often imagine where the jail is. But it&#x2019;s usually in the middle, with other civic buildings. So while I&#x2019;m not sure where the Bellingham jail is exactly, I do know where the library is, as Tim and I had taken my mother there for her to compare it with our family&#x2019;s other favorite city libraries just that week. In our family, books were sacred and given far more easily than hugs. Reading aloud a good book was far more natural for Mom than maternal touch. So a good library? Fantastic.<br><br>I look up the jail address and get Tim&#x2019;s goodie bag, remicrowaving the washcloth one last time so it will be warm, like they provide at overthought restaurants between courses. I head downtown.<br><br>After a few wrong turns using the library as landmark, I pull up to the loading zone. I see Tim standing in front of the jail, wearing the suit he married me in. The vintage olive green coat over his arm, white sleeves rolled up. He looks older. He&#x2019;d always looked so young for his age. My friend Nessa from second grade has always called him Opie with a Bod because he has such sweet innocent face atop one spectacularly broad chest. But there he is, my beautiful husband, looking like the saddest person in the world. My heart breaks for him. I know, whatever has happened, that I love him, can see his beauty&#x2014;the way he steps into the car with a certain extra quiet self-consciousness, a certain asking for permission. I also know&#x2014;as sure as I know my own name&#x2014;that whatever his truth, I have zero interest in ever adding to the look of suffering and shame I now see before me. My only hope, in fact, is to lessen it. This, the only clear thought I&#x2019;ve had between last night and now. Amid the mystery, only one clear thing. My role as his wife and partner: to support the navigation through whatever waters he finds himself. Or through whatever waters we find ourselves. I picked this boat. He picked this boat. We picked this boat. But neither the waters nor the weather can ever be predicted. Herein lies the tricky part&#x2014;having some agreement on whose waters one or both of you are in.<br><br>We start driving south on I-5 to get his car. He directs me to keep driving past the route home. Glancing back and forth between him and the road I ask, &#x201c;I thought it all happened right before our turnoff. Why are we heading way down here?&#x201d;<br><br>There is a vast silence. My stomach drops.<br><br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s just wait to talk about it when we get home,&#x201d; he says.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>No.<br><br>Root<br><br>Every person in the house felt that there was no sense in their living together, and that the stray people brought together by chance in any inn had more in common with one another than they . . .<br><br>&#x2014;Anna Karenina<br><br>1<br><br>Mental Work<br><br>Purpose: It&#x2019;s our family slang for a Christian Science thing.

They kind of think death doesn&#x2019;t actually exist&#x2014;nor pain, suffering, nor even the idea of difficulty. Maybe better said, they think death can kind of exist, but awkwardly, sort of illogically existing and not existing simultaneously, and only if you understand that in the end these messy little things like pain and death don&#x2019;t actually ever happen.

Wilson"Christian Book Previews" (05/01/2005)</p><h2>The Mesmerist</h2><p>Medicine, in the early 1800s, was a brutal business. Operations were performed without anaesthesia while conventional treatment relied on leeches, cupping and toxic potions. The most surgeons could offer by way of pain relief was a large swig of brandy. Onto this scene came John Elliotson, the dazzling new hope of the medical world. Charismatic and ambitious, Elliotson was determined to transform medicine from a hodge-podge of archaic remedies into a practice informed by the latest science. In this aim he was backed by Thomas Wakley, founder of the new magazine, the Lancet , and a campaigner against corruption and malpractice. Then, in the summer of 1837, a French visitor - the self-styled Baron Jules Denis Dupotet - arrived in London to promote an exotic new idea: mesmerism. The mesmerism mania would take the nation by storm but would ultimately split the two friends, and the medical world, asunder - throwing into focus fundamental questions about the fine line between medicine and quackery, between science and superstition.</p><p>Wendy Moore is a freelance journalist and author.

Ranging from comedy to tragedy, pious sermon to ribald farce, heroic adventure to passionate romance, the tales serve not only as a summation of the sensibility of the Middle Ages but as a representation of the drama of the human condition.<br><br> Ackroyd&#x2019;s contemporary prose emphasizes the humanity of these characters&#x2014;as well as explicitly rendering the naughty good humor of the writer whose comedy influenced Fielding and Dickens&#x2014;yet still masterfully evokes the euphonies and harmonies of Chaucer&#x2019;s verse. This retelling is sure to delight modern readers and bring a new appreciation to those already familiar with the classic tales.<p><br></p></p><p>Peter Ackroyd is an award-winning novelist, critic, and biographer.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by Steven Levingston Remember struggling over "The Canterbury Tales" in high school? It was a labor of laughs borne only for the puerile joy of reading about farts and arse-kissing. And there was this weird recognition: Could people really have been so much like us 600 years ago? For the pleasure of it all, you had to put up with English that was nothing like the English you knew. As Chaucer wrote of the Wife of Bath: Housbondes at chirche-dore she hadde fyve, Withouten other companye in youthe . . . In felawschip wel coude she laughe and carpe. Of remedyes of love she knew perchaunce, For she coude of that art the olde daunce. Now here comes Peter Ackroyd, novelist, biographer and historian, with "The Canterbury Tales" for a new generation -- it's Chaucer in vivid, expressive English exactly as you speak it. Here in Ackroyd-ese, the same passage quoted above: "She had been married in church five times but, in her youth, she had enjoyed any number of liaisons. . . . She had performed in that game before. She knew, as they say, the ways of the dance." Of course, "The Canterbury Tales" is far more than its ribaldry. It gives a rich and complex portrait of the sensibility of the Middle Ages and, in its original, is beautiful poetry. As Ackroyd remarks, "It is one of the greatest poems in all of English literature, one that will last as long as the language itself endures." levingstons@washpost.com <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

There are twenty-one floors of air between me and the concrete pavement below. I am about to do what I do best. I am about to jump."<br><br>If you're a fan of action-adventure movies--with the accent on action--then you no doubt love watching Jackie Chan risk his life to create sensational cinema. As one of the biggest stars to burst into U.S. theaters, Jackie has put America's hottest heroes to shame, wowing audiences with the breathless, death-defying stunts that are the highlight of such movies as Rumble in the Bronx, Supercop, Operation: Condor, and his newest blockbuster Rush Hour. But who really is this boyishly handsome, lightning-fast Charlie Chaplin of martial arts movie-making? And what possessed him to make a career out of putting his life on the line to keep us on the edge of our seats?<br><br>"I remember a frightened seven-year-old walking into the dim and musty halls of the China Drama Academy, clutching his father's hand. Inside, he sees paradise--young boys and girls leaping and tumbling and flashing the steel of ancient weapons. 'How long do you want to stay here, Jackie?' 'Forever!' answered the boy, his eyes bright and wide. And he let go of his father's hand to clutch at the Master's hem. . . ."<br><br>In I Am Jackie Chan, Chan tells the fascinating, harrowing, ultimately triumphant story of his life: How the rebellious son of refugees in tumultuous 1950s Hong Kong became the disciplined disciple of a Chinese Opera Master. How the "paradise" that young Jackie so eagerly embraced proved to be, in reality, a ruthlessly competitive place whose fierce master wielded the legal authority to train his students even to death. How the dying art of Chinese opera led Jackie to the movie business--and how he made the leap from stuntman to superstar. How he broke into the Hollywood big time by breaking almost every bone in his body.<br><br>Finally, after years of plunging off skyscrapers and living to tell the tale, Jackie Chan proves--with this witty, poignant, and often astonishing memoir--that it's always been a tale well worth telling.<br><br>Jackie has written this book with Jeff Yang, the founder of A Magazine and the author of Eastern Standard: A Guide To Asian Influence in American Culture.</p><p>Since his first role in 1962 at the age of 8, Jackie Chan has appeared in more than 70 movies. For more than 20 years, he has been the biggest star in Asia, but in the West he remained a secret, his movies passed around on tape and his fame growing by word of mouth alone. In the '90s, with the success of crossover movies like <i>Rush Hour</i> and the support of a new generation of filmmakers who grew up watching Jackie Chan videotapes, his star finally rose in the West. But where did he come from, and how did he achieve so much?<p> His autobiography, <i>I Am Jackie Chan</i>, answers those questions in an engaging, almost novelistic style. When his father moves to Australia to take up a new job, the young Jackie is placed in Hong Kong's China Drama Academy under the tutelage of Master Yu Jim-yuen. For the next 10 years he is trained in martial arts, dance, acrobatics, singing, and comedy, while suffering extraordinary hardships, including regular beatings and near-starvation. Yet he can look back on this period of his life with considerable affection, not least because it taught him the skills, and provided him with the network of friends, that would sustain his film career for decades. Chan has always earned the respect of his fans by committing himself wholeheartedly to creating the most death-defying stunts possible. His achievements seem even more remarkable when set against the struggles described in this book. In the Drama School, as a young stuntman, in his first troubled attempts to make movies in America--Chan's personality shines through, and <i>I Am Jackie Chan</i> can only enhance his reputation as one of the most likable and admirable movie stars in the world. The book also includes Jackie's comments on all of his movies, lists of his favorite stunts and fights, and an astonishing catalog of all his major injuries. Can you imagine what it must feel like to dislocate your cheekbone? <i>--Simon Leake</i></p>My husband's a huge Bruce Lee fan and when he heard we were doing a Jackie Chan<br>book he got very excited.

Georg Steller would introduce the world to the staggering wealth and diversity of life of the North Pacific, providing the first European accounts of the sea otter, sea lion, northern fur seal, native Alaskan Chugach people, and more. Steller's Island is a fascinating tale of the rewards and perils of exploration in this era. It is about the courage of scientific curiosity, even in uncharted waters, alien lands, and desperate circumstances, including storms, scurvy, and shipwreck.<br>Steller traveled deep into the wild with little on his back. In the one day Bering permitted him to explore Kayak Island along the southern Alaskan coast, he catalogued more than one hundred previously unknown plants. He was the only European naturalist to see the spectacled cormorant alive and his is our one and only account of the now extinct Steller's sea cow. In accounts of the Chugach and Aleut people, Steller was the first scientist to hypothesize an Asian origin for Native Americans. The crew of the St. Peter credited him with their lives: His novel prescription of wild greens cured their scurvy, and his knowledge of sea mammals and Native hunting techniques meant food for the starving. <br></p><p><table> <tbody><tr> <td></td> <td><p><b>DEAN LITTLEPAGE</b> served as a special exhibits curator for the Anchorage Museum of History and Art.

She lives in Franklin, Tennessee with her husband and three children. <p></p><p><strong>Chapter One</strong></p><p>We moved to our home in Medina, Ohio, in the spring of 1970, when I was three. My brother, Brian, was seven and got his own room, the green one with the short, shaggy dark green carpet. I shared a room with my sister Mary Jo (we call her Josie... like Jocie, not Jozey), who is nearly ten years older than me. We got the baby-aspirin-orange room with the orange shag carpet, and my parents got the all-purple room. The family room was pink, the living room blue, and the kitchen had bluish-green-patterned indoor/outdoor carpeting and avocado appliances. The house screamed 1960s.</p><p>There were a few homes on our road but it was mostly farmland. Our split-level house had a long, blacktop driveway, huge front lawn, brick front, a white barn in the back that would hold my dad&#x2019;s tractors and gardening equipment, and over an acre of land behind the barn for a garden that could feed most of Medina County (my parents never believed in small gardens). Our neighbor Mr. Lake also had a garden behind his barn. Bud Lake had a round chest that was slick as a watermelon. It actually glistened on hot summer days when he worked outside. When we met Mr. Lake for the first time I whispered to my mother, &#x201c;That man doesn&#x2019;t have any hair on his chest.&#x201d; She tried to shush me but I was three and lacked whispering skills. Mr. Lake believed in using manure for fertilizer. He&#x2019;d haul in a huge load from somewhere and let it percolate inside his barn before he used it. His garden always smelled crappy, but it was lovely.</p><p>A dairy was just up the street and Mr. Lake walked to work there every morning with his lunch pail in hand. Sometimes (but not nearly enough) he&#x2019;d bring home a package of ice-cream bars and hand them to me. Life couldn&#x2019;t get any better than on those free ice-cream-bar days. One morning as I played in the driveway I was talking to myself, weaving together an outlandish tale full of colorful characters, intrigue, and drama. I froze when I saw Mr. Lake peering from behind one of his trees, listening to me. &#x201c;Go on,&#x201c; he said. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t wait to hear what happens.&#x201d; Stage fright hit me and I couldn&#x2019;t utter another word. I ran toward our garage door and heard Mr. Lake laughing from his yard.</p><p>Across the road was a pasture full of cows for the dairy and right next to us was an old farmhouse where our other neighbors lived. For the sake of this story I&#x2019;ll just call them the &#x201c;Taylors.&#x201d; Theirs was not a charming farmhouse in any way. The exterior hadn&#x2019;t been painted in years and what was left of the old paint fell like curly, white pencil shavings around the house. A distinct odor of aged, rotting wood, cigarettes, and filth met you before stepping onto the porch. My mother was and is a no-nonsense woman. She and my father both grew up in east Tennessee working on farms that fed fifteen children in my father&#x2019;s family and five in my mother&#x2019;s. My dad&#x2019;s oldest sibling, my Aunt Stella, was born the same year as my maternal grandmother, Mary Hurley. As Grandma Hurley grew, got married, and began having children of her own, my paternal grandmother was still giving birth to her fifteen children. When she died in 1972, her death certificate claimed she was just worn out.</p><p>My mother was always very practical (as I write this sitting at a plastic folding table I know the apple hasn&#x2019;t fallen too far from the tree) and called things as she saw them. On more than one occasion I remember her looking at our neighbor&#x2019;s home and saying, &#x201c;Move next to a dump and you live next to trash.&#x201d; I didn&#x2019;t know what she meant.</p><p>When we moved to Medina my mom worked at the latex factory, the flower container factory, and then later, the box factory. (My sister eventually worked at the pickle factory.) My mother settled on cleaning homes as a business because she could set her own hours and be home when we got off the school bus in the afternoon. My dad worked second shift in one of the steel mills in Cleveland, the same one he&#x2019;d worked in since he moved to Ohio in 1955 and ultimately retired from forty years later. At night I&#x2019;d fall asleep in my mother&#x2019;s bed and when my dad got home in the early morning hours he would carry me to my orange room. I never remembered a thing.</p><p>After I learned to read I would crawl into bed with my mom and read her stories. Mother would come home from the factory and make dinner for my siblings and me, maybe do a load of laundry, or scrub a spot on the indoor/outdoor kitchen carpet before turning in each night. I&#x2019;d rifle through my books or the ones we&#x2019;d picked up at the library and read one after the other out loud to my mother as she fell asleep. I&#x2019;d look over at her and think, &#x201c;Why are you so tired?&#x201d; I&#x2019;d read till I got sleepy and then turn out the light, thinking about new books to bring home.</p><p>The Franklin Sylvester Library was just off the square in Medina. I would crawl on the floor between the stacks of books in the children&#x2019;s section in search of two or three new ones to take home. Long before I could read I loved to flip through the pages of a book and look at the pictures. The individual volumes in the Childcraft books that still stand on my parents&#x2019; shelves reveal my scribbling then as I learned my ABCs and my failed attempts to write my name (the Ns are still backward). One winter&#x2019;s night my mother bundled me up to take books back to the library. I set three books on top of the car while I put on my boots but forgot them as I climbed into my seat. When we got to the library I searched the car for the books, thinking I&#x2019;d left them at home. Mother discovered one of the books still sitting on top of the car; the other two had no doubt come to an ugly ending somewhere along the route. I was petrified as we walked into the library, so frightened that the lady behind the desk would take away our library card or worse yet, that she&#x2019;d ban me from stepping foot inside the library again. I don&#x2019;t remember if my mother paid for the books or if the woman behind the desk was just gracious to an absentminded child but we left that evening after checking out two new books. We went home and had a piece of chocolate cake. There was always dessert in my mother&#x2019;s kitchen.</p><p>My mother was and still is an amazing cook. She had dinner on the table every night. A little neighbor girl up the road timed her visits to our house at dinnertime and was always ecstatic when my mom asked if she wanted to stay for dinner. &#x201c;Oh, is it dinnertime? I guess I could stay,&#x201c; she&#x2019;d say, filling her plate. She was accustomed to Ramen noodles or a cold sandwich and was just beside herself when my mother put mashed potatoes, green beans, corn, coleslaw, corn bread, and baked chicken on the table. My mother was raised on a Southern farm and in the South you do not have a meal unless there are at least three vegetables on the table. That&#x2019;s the rule. We had a little dog named Jack; he was part Pekingese and part Pomeranian, not a good mix for children. He was high strung and temperamental and my arms still bear scars from more than one run-in with him. After any meal we could drop a piece of food into his dish, plink, plunk, and he&#x2019;d come tearing through the house. My mother took him to the joint vocational school to get his hair cut once and the students shaved him bald except for the fur on his head. He looked like a Dr. Seuss cartoon animal and was so ashamed that he came home and hid under the drum table in the corner of the blue living room. One morning my mother caught him taking his daily constitution in her bedroom and she was so angry that she picked him up and shook him. Tiny poop shot out like torpedoes onto the purple carpet and she ran for the door with Jack hanging like a sack of potatoes in front of her. That was high comedy for a kid and I fell down laughing. My mother didn&#x2019;t. Jack was mean, but I loved him; he was a constant playmate. Give me a few Barbies, baby dolls, and Jack, and I was set for the day. I was a happy kid.</p><p>George and Tess Taylor lived next door to us with their five children, all of whom were much older than me except Tom, who was my age. Sometime after our move I walked with my mother across the field that divided our homes and met the Taylors. Tom was in the yard playing with the family&#x2019;s shaggy, bounding yellow dog. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Tom,&#x201c; he said, pounding the dog&#x2019;s side. &#x201c;And this is Ziggy, the butt-sniffing dog.&#x201d; He smacked the dog&#x2019;s muzzle back and forth and took off running. Ziggy chased after him and pushed his snoot into Tom&#x2019;s rear end, hoisting him into the air. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s why we call him a butt sniffer,&#x201c; Tom yelled, laughing.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop doing that to that dog,&#x201c; Tess said, taking a drag off her cigarette. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll turn him mean.&#x201d; Tess had a mess of reddish-orange hair and the longest toenails I&#x2019;d ever seen in my life. She was wearing sandals (no way those nails could .t inside a shoe) and an orange jumpsuit with a belt that tied in the front. Although it was the seventies I can proudly say that my mother never owned a polyester jumpsuit. Tess was down to earth and warm, and called me &#x201c;Sugar Pop&#x201d; most of the time.</p><p>Tom had dark hair and eyes like his dad, his brother Kevin, and his sister Cindy, who had enormous breasts. Of course the hugeness was accentuated by the lack of bra she often excluded. As Tom and I played in the backyard one day he stopped, doubled over, and vomited right on his feet. I ran to the house to find Cindy. She was on the front porch, ironing. Her breasts swayed from side to side as she moved the iron back and forth over a shirt. &#x201c;Tom just puked,&#x201c; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;He did what?&#x201d;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t remember the other word for puke. My mind raced: It was a grown-up word, what did it start with? Hurry. Hurry. Oh, I got nothing. &#x201c;He just opened his mou...</p></p><h2>Altered States: The Autobiography of Ken Russell</h2><p>The renowned director of more than fifty films tells his life story in a cinematic style that flashes back to his childhood and the experiences that influenced his art and touches upon his failed marriage and his film industry colleagues</p><p>The former enfant terrible of British cinema, now in his 60s, bares all, pretty much. Russell takes his life episodically, hopping about with flashbacks and flashforwards in no particular chronology. In print, he is a charming, sometimes waspish storyteller with axes to grind only against his American distributors who have taken his pictures and lopped off whole reels (e.g., The Boy Friend). Raised in the working-class, he introduces us to his mother and father as dad prepares senile mom for her last days in a nursing home. He pieces together his days in the RAF and the Merchant Marine and five years as a ballet student and dancer. Russell early fell in love with photography, and his amateur films earned him entrance into TV, where he made exciting shows about composers. That these shows were often viewed as pictorially cuckoo travesties in no way damped his spirits: he didn't see them that way. And he had access to bottled spirits anyway, ever breakfasting on a half-bottle of champagne to get the morning charged up, with an iced bucket of bubbly at his side throughout the day's shooting. Through Russell's eyes, his work seems a lot less appalling than it is famed to be--a fame reinforced by the posing Nazis in Mahler, the TV set that erupts with chocolate sauce and buries Ann-Margaret in Tommy, the shrinkage of Liszt to rock-'n'-roll pop-star satyr in Lisztomania (a degradation Russell feels was forced upon him when he was unbankable). Highlights include duels with Paddy Chayevsky during the making of Altered States and with Bob Guccione for an aborted Moll Flanders, his first wife Shirley's tit-for-tat adultery with their chauffeur, and Oliver Reed's way of puffing himself up behind a screen for the nude wrestling scene in Women in Love. A modest demythologizing from the horse's mouth. (Photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>British filmmaker Russell virtually defines the word "iconoclast" with a career in television and motion pictures studded with controversy, mainly over his interpretations of the lives of famous artists. Isadora Duncan, Tchaikovsky, Liszt, Mahler, and Delius have all received "the Russell treatment," provoking howls of outrage from critics and lovers of their art. Russell has also been attracted to sources as diverse as D.H. Lawrence ( Women in Love , 1969), Sandy Wilson ( The Boy Friend , 1971), and Paddy Chayevsky ( Altered States , 1980). In this freewheeling self-portrait, Russell wanders through his life and career, offering few apologies or explanations. In spots his book can be as entertaining as his best work, but like many of his films it is ultimately less than satisfying.

In the service of wealthy Spanish conquistadors in the sixteenth century, Mexican ranch hands began herd- ing cattle, often riding barefoot. They soon developed and perfected the skills for this dangerous work and became expert horsemen. Hundred of years later the vaqueros shared their expertise with the inexperienced cowboys of the American West, who adopted their techniques and their distinctive clothing, tools, and even lingo.

Horses have long suffered from tree points impeding the movement of their shoulder blades; too narrow gullet channels damaging the muscles and nerves along the vertebrae; and too long panels putting harmful pressure on the reflex point in the loin area. Male riders saddle up despite riding-related pain and the potential for serious side effects, such as impotence, while female riders endure backache, slipped discs, and bladder infections, to name just a few common issues. </p><p> </p><p>We must ask ourselves: How much better could we ride and how much better could our horses perform if our saddles fit optimally? If they accommodated the horse&#x2019;s unique conformation and natural asymmetry? If they were built for the differing anatomy of men and women? </p><p> </p><p>The answers to all these questions are right here, right now, in this book.</p></p><p><p><b>Jochen Schleese </b>was certified as the youngest Master Saddler ever in Europe in 1984, and in 1986 was asked to be the official saddler for the World Dressage Championship.

Melissa has no recollection of his murder and is terrified that he will avenge himself by taking her life. When she meets the "real" Paul at a dance, she begins to understand that his death will occur in the future, and she and the ghost Paul unsuccessfully try to change the future. Readers will identify with Melissa, who is caring and compassionate, while Paul is a typical tough guy. Still, his is a well-drawn characterization. In other titles in this series, Fear Street is described as a menacing place; the appropriate details help create and sustain that mood. That description is glossed over in this book, diminishing the suspense. While this could be purchased as an addition to the series, it's better to hook new readers with one of the earlier books first. --Molly Kinney, North Dade Regional Lib . , Miami, FL<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Influx</h2><p><b>What if our civilization is more advanced than we know?</b><br><br>The <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Daemon</i>--"the cyberthriller against which all others will be measured" -Publishers Weekly) --imagines a world in which decades of technological advances have been suppressed in an effort to prevent disruptive change.<br><br>Are smart phones really humanity's most significant innovation since the moon landings?

My sister&#x2019;s pug just went rabid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re kidding.&#x201d; Marrano thumbed the controls of his handheld game console.</p><p>&#x201c;Raccoon bite. They had to put Mr. Chips down. Her kids are still in therapy.&#x201d; Mashing buttons on his own wireless console, Sloan Johnson sat in the nearby passenger seat. Then he let out a deep &#x201c;Heh, heh.&#x201d;</p><p>Marrano cast a look at him. Johnson had that Cheshire cat grin on his face again. &#x201c;Shit . . .&#x201d; Marrano tried to rotate his player around, but Johnson&#x2019;s avatar was already behind him.</p><p>Double-tap. The screen faded. </p><p>&#x201c;You really do suck at this, Al.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Goddamnit!&#x201d; Marrano tossed the device onto the car&#x2019;s stitched leather dashboard and pounded the steering wheel. &#x201c;You have got to be kidding me. Worse than playing my goddamn nephew.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s two thousand bucks you owe me.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Best out of five?&#x201d;</p><p>Johnson powered down his device. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a lousy two K. What are you complaining about?&#x201d;</p><p>Headlights swept across them as another car turned into the nearly empty parking lot of a gritty industrial building.</p><p>&#x201c;Here we go.&#x201d; Marrano pocketed his e-cigarette. </p><p>&#x201c;&#x2019;Bout fucking time.&#x201d;</p><p>They exited their parked Aston Martin One-77 as an older Mercedes pulled toward them.</p><p>&#x201c;Jesus, look at this thing.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;They go forever, though.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You ever get stuck behind one of these on the highway? Like breathing coal dust.&#x201d; He motioned for the driver to pull up to them.</p><p>The Mercedes parked, and a distinguished, if disheveled, elderly South Asian man with spectacles and a full head of unconvincing jet-black hair got out. Slowly. He buttoned his greatcoat against the cold.</p><p>Marrano and Johnson approached, removing their leather gloves and extending hands. Marrano smiled. &#x201c;Doctor Kulkarni. Albert Marrano. Thanks for coming out so late.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; They shook hands. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t usually drive at night. But your CEO said this couldn&#x2019;t wait.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That she did.&#x201d; Marrano turned. &#x201c;This is my colleague, Sloan John- son. He manages the portfolio for Shearson-Bayers.&#x201d;</p><p>They shook hands as well. &#x201c;Pleased to meet you.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Likewise.&#x201d;</p><p>Marrano pulled his lambskin glove back on. &#x201c;So you&#x2019;re our physicist. Princeton, right?&#x201d;</p><p>Kulkarni nodded. &#x201c;Yes, but I live close by in Holmdel. No one would tell me what this is about.&#x201d;</p><p>Marrano grimaced. &#x201c;Not over the phone, no. Legal says they already have you under contract, so I&#x2019;m supposed to remind you about your nondisclosure agreement and noncompete clause.&#x201d;</p><p>The elderly Indian nodded impatiently. &#x201c;Fine, fine. Now what is this &#x2018;physics emergency&#x2019; of yours?&#x201d;</p><p>Marrano waved his arm to encompass the drab, windowless building before them. &#x201c;Tech start-up. Run by a couple particle physicists developing chiral superconductors. The investment predates me, but these guys claim they&#x2019;ve made some big breakthrough. I&#x2019;ll be damned if I can understand a thing they&#x2019;re saying.&#x201d;</p><p>Johnson edged in. &#x201c;We need you to evaluate their scientific claims. Tell us if they&#x2019;re on the level.&#x201d;</p><p>Kulkarni nodded. &#x201c;Is there a business plan or lab report I can review?&#x201d;</p><p>Both men exchanged looks. Marrano answered, &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t part with printed material at this point, Professor. You&#x2019;ll have to review this firsthand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then I&#x2019;ll need to speak with the founders. Tour the facility.&#x201d; Kulkarni eyed the darkened building.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, they&#x2019;re in there.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;This late?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. Blowing through thirty thousand dollars an hour in off-peak electricity.&#x201d;</p><p>An electrical hum became all the more noticeable from behind a nearby fenced transformer yard as he mentioned it.</p><p>&#x201c;We were told not to leave this place or talk to anyone until we got confirmation from an expert. Apparently whatever these guys sent the egg heads in New York turned some heads. Frankly, I have my doubts.&#x201d;</p><p>Johnson added, &#x201c;We&#x2019;re supposed to have you confirm that it&#x2019;s for real.&#x201d;</p><p>Kulkarni adjusted his spectacles to keep them from fogging. &#x201c;That what&#x2019;s for real?&#x201d;</p><p>Marrano shrugged. &#x201c;Like I said: I don&#x2019;t even understand it. Something about &#x2018;ionic lattices.&#x2019; Follow me.&#x201d; He brought them toward a windowless steel door in a nearby brick wall, then tapped in a code at a keypad. The door beeped and unlocked. He ushered them inside.</p><p>The group walked down a narrow drywall corridor with a lofty ceiling. Ahead they could hear the echo of laughter in a cavernous space. A deep hum permeated the corridor, along with the smell of ozone. There was a loud bang somewhere, followed again by hoots of laughter and breaking glass.</p><p>&#x201c;Is it safe?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not sure, Professor.&#x201d; Marrano walked onward.</p><p>Moments later, the trio came out into a large, darkened workspace, with a high, exposed girder ceiling. Work lights glowed from the center of the room, casting long shadows on the walls. Big as it was, the room was still cluttered&#x2014;its edges lined with overflowing shelving units and banks of heavy-duty electrical capacitors. LED lights glowed on the equipment, digital readouts fluctuating widely. Rows of rubber-topped lab tables stood in their path, every inch piled high with circuit boards, oscillators, 3D printers, and heaps of electrical components. There were also origami geodesic models in all sizes. The place looked more like the attic of an eccentric hoarder than a laboratory.</p><p>Marrano halted them as he noticed shattered glass, broken furniture, and unknown liquids scattered across the concrete floor. A glance up also revealed dents and holes pounded into the wall behind them. They were downrange of something.</p><p>A burst of light in the center of the room drew their attention to a towering circular assembly. It was roughly ten feet in diameter and rose up to the thirty-foot-high ceiling. Thick electrical cables snaked through it, woven in and out of metal scaffolding and what appeared to be color-coded coolant piping. There were OSHA warning signs for high voltages, liquid gases, and corrosive chemicals. The assembly was clearly the focus of much organized activity, while the rest of the room had been allowed to go feral.</p><p>At the heart of the massive assembly was a concave stone or ceramic pedestal several feet in diameter&#x2014;shaped like a lens&#x2014;above which was an array of metal rods, their tips aimed at the center of an imaginary sphere. The open space that the sphere encompassed was roughly six feet in diameter. Other sensor arrays and test rigs were distributed around the platform as well&#x2014;tubes, pipes, wires, cameras, and more inscrutable devices, all aimed at the empty space at the heart of the machine.</p><p>Next to it stood the silhouettes of four men in coveralls with an assortment of hard hats, lab goggles, and, on one, a black paintball mask. They were crowded around a flat-panel computer monitor perched on a cart. Cables ran from it back into the scaffolding tower. As they read the contents of the screen, one of the researchers suddenly shouted, &#x201c;Off-axis acceleration zero-point-nine-three-nine! Hell, yeah, baby!&#x201d;</p><p>They high-fived one another, shouting with joy, and clinked together what appeared to be large bottles of beer. They danced around, arm in arm like devils before a fire, their shadows cavorting along the walls.</p><p>Marrano shouted, &#x201c;Hey! What the hell, guys?&#x201d;</p><p>The men stopped and looked to the doorway. The one with the paint- ball mask flipped it up to reveal a youthful bearded face. He smiled and raised a half-empty malt liquor bottle. &#x201c;Marrano! Just in time. Check this out.&#x201d;</p><p>Marrano sighed in irritation as he, Johnson, and Kulkarni gingerly navigated around broken glass and pools of liquid. He frowned. &#x201c;This place is a mess, Mr. Grady.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maid&#x2019;s on vacation. Get on over here.&#x201d;</p><p>The other researchers stood alongside Grady, all wearing blue coveralls with a white number forty-one embroidered over the chest pocket. Two were young Asian men&#x2014;one of them plump but tall, the other wiry like a wrestler. Next to them was a scholarly looking Caucasian man in his seventies or eighties, wearing a sweater and necktie beneath his loose-fitting blue coveralls. He leaned on a cane, visibly guarded about the new visitors.</p><p>Marrano gestured as they made their way closer. &#x201c;Jon Grady, this is Doctor Sameer Kulkarni, Princeton University plasma physics lab. He&#x2019;s here to evaluate&#x201d;&#x2014;his eyes trailed up the towering assembly&#x2014;&#x201c;whatever the hell this is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Doctor Kulkarni, great to meet you.&#x201d; Grady waved them in with welding-gloved hands. He gestured to his team. &#x201c;That burly guy over there is Raharjo Perkasa, postdoc out of Jersey Tech. That&#x2019;s Michael Lum, our chemical engineer from Rutgers.&#x201d;</p><p>Both the young men nodded. &#x201c;And over here&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Kulkarni was distracted momentarily as he bumped against an origami polyhedron on a nearby table&#x2014;but then he took notice of the fourth researcher. &#x201c;Doctor Alcot. Bertrand Alcot.&#x201d; He laughed. &#x201c;What on earth are you doing here? How long has it been?&#x201d;</p><p>The elderly Alcot smiled as they shook hands heartily. &#x201c;A good five or six years, I think.&#x201d;</p><p>Marrano and Johnson exchanged looks. &#x201c;You know each other?&#x201d; </p><p>Kulkarni nodded. &#x201c;Doctor Alcot and I coauthored a paper on hydrodynamics long ago. While he was at Columbia. I thought you retired, Bert.&#x201d; </p><p>Alcot nodded. &#x201c;From the university, yes. I was encouraged to retire. So I did.&#x201d;</p><p>Kulkarni seemed to be trying to recall something. &#x201c;The last thing I read of yours was . . .&#x201d; He hesitated. &#x201c;Well, it was rather controversial, if I remember.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s diplomatic of you. It was a paper on modified Newtonian dynamics.&#x201d;</p><p>There was an awkward silence.</p><p>Grady spoke as he tapped away at a computer keyboard. &#x201c;Doctor Alcot&#x2019;s career difficulties are my fault, I&#x2019;m afraid. I&#x2019;ve been told I&#x2019;m a bad influence.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You are a bad influence.&#x201d; Alcot gestured to Grady. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been pestering me for years with his strange ideas.&#x201d;</p><p>Grady snorted as he studied the numbers on his computer screen. </p><p>Alcot continued, &#x201c;I tried mathematically disproving Jon&#x2019;s theories but couldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He leaned back on his cane. &#x201c;After Greta passed away, Jon convinced me to come join him here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My condolences on Greta. I hadn&#x2019;t heard. When did she pass, Bert?&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;About two years ago now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So sorry to hear it.&#x201d; Kulkarni glanced back to Grady. &#x201c;Then Mr. Grady worked with you at Columbia?&#x201d;</p><p>Grady shook his head, still studying the computer monitor. &#x201c;Heh. I&#x2019;m no scholar. I flunked out of a state college.&#x201d;</p><p>Alcot added. &#x201c;Jon has a master&#x2019;s in physics.&#x201d; He paused and somewhat sheepishly added, &#x201c;An online degree.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, I see. Then how did you two . . . ?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jon&#x2019;s been emailing me for years. Incredibly persistent. Got to the point I could no longer ignore him. It was either that or a restraining order.&#x201d; Alcot gestured to the towering assembly. &#x201c;This is the result.&#x201d;</p><p>Kulkarni looked to Marrano, then back to Alcot. &#x201c;Then it was Mr. Grady who formed the company?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;With other people&#x2019;s money.&#x201d; Marrano picked up one of several origami geometric shapes from a nearby table. He gazed at the researchers meaningfully. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t heard anyone mention chiral superconductors yet.&#x201d;</p><p>Grady answered as his fingers clattered at the keyboard. &#x201c;Do you even know what chiral superconductors are, Mr. Marrano?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, and it&#x2019;s not for lack of trying. But I do know the government invested in this place. So someone somewhere must understand it.&#x201d;</p><p>Grady smiled. &#x201c;And thus marches Wall Street.&#x201d;</p><p>Marrano tossed the paper model aside and turned back to Kulkarni. &#x201c;Can you please find out what&#x2019;s going on? I&#x2019;d like to get back to the city.&#x201d; </p><p>Johnson eyed the large bottles of cheap beer in the researchers&#x2019; hands. &#x201c;You guys always drink while you&#x2019;re messing around with high-voltage equipment?&#x201d;</p><p>Alcot gave the barest hint of a smile. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re celebrating.&#x201d;</p><p>Again Grady barely looked up from his keyboard as he answered for Alcot. &#x201c;Bert&#x2019;s right. Tonight is a special night. As you&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d; He finished typing, then looked up to regard them. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m guessing you&#x2019;ll all need a drink soon enough.&#x201d;</p><p>Marrano and Johnson exchanged unimpressed looks. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the forty-one stand for?&#x201d; Marrano gestured to the number on the researchers&#x2019; coveralls.</p><p>Grady tossed his paintball mask onto a nearby tool cart. He now looked like a BMW mechanic in blue coveralls. He pulled back his unruly, shoulder-length hair, wrapping it into a ponytail as he spoke. &#x201c;Forty-one represents a starting point. Prime numbers are the atoms of mathematics. Viewed on an equilateral grid, the number forty-one appears at the very center of all the prime numbers below one hundred. And if we consider de Polignac&#x2019;s conjecture, the fractal nature of that numerical array has tremendous significance at higher scales.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Jesus . . .&#x201d; Marrano and Johnson again exchanged looks.</p><p>Alcot interceded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll grant you that Jon has some eccentricities, gentlemen, but I&#x2019;ve begun to realize that he simply has a different perspective on things.&#x201d;</p><p>Marrano gazed at the dozens of origami shapes scattered among electrical components on nearby tables. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a shocker.&#x201d;</p><p>Alcot picked up one of the shapes. &#x201c;Non-Euclidean curved surface folding. Jon sometimes thinks through problems with his hands.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It helps with certain problem sets.&#x201d; Grady approached them, apparently noticing the dubious look on the investor&#x2019;s faces. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s fair to say I&#x2019;ve strayed a bit from my business plan.&#x201d;</p><p>Marrano scowled. &#x201c;Strayed? I can&#x2019;t even see your business plan from here. I&#x2019;ve been going through your expenses. You&#x2019;ve blown through half your annual budget in the last three months on utility bills alone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;An opportunity cost.&#x201d; Grady gestured to the towering apparatus. &#x201c;High energies are necessary to induce exotic states in baryonic matter.

She brings to life an extraordinary woman, fluent in five languages, a free-spirited patron of the arts, a daredevil, a practical joker, and a passionate lover. Isabella, in fact, conducted numerous affairs, including a ten-year relationship with the cousin of her violent and possessive husband. Her permissive lifestyle, however, came to an end upon the death of her father, who was succeeded by her disapproving older brother Francesco. Considering Isabella's ways to be licentious and a disgrace upon the family, he permitted her increasingly enraged husband to murder her in a remote Medici villa. To tell this dramatic story, Murphy draws on a vast trove of newly discovered and unpublished documents, ranging from Isabella's own letters, to the loose-tongued dispatches of ambassadors to Florence, to contemporary descriptions of the opulent parties and balls, salons and hunts in which Isabella and her associates participated. Murphy resurrects the exciting atmosphere of Renaissance Florence, weaving Isabella's beloved city into her story, evoking the intellectual and artistic community that thrived during her time. Palaces and gardens in the city become places of creativity and intrigue, sites of seduction, and grounds for betrayal. <br> Here then is a narrative of compelling and epic proportions, magnificent and alluring, decadent and ultimately tragic.<br><br></p><p><br><strong>Caroline P. Murphy</strong> is a cultural historian and biographer who lives in Cambridge, Mass. She is the author of <em>Lavinia Fontana: A Painter and Her Patrons in Sixteenth-Century Bologna</em> and <em>The Pope's Daughter: The Extraordinary Life of Felice Della Rovere</em>.<br>The third of eight surviving children, Isabella de' Medici (1542&#x2013;1576) was unusually close to her father, Cosimo, the powerful grand duke of Tuscany who built the Uffizi, and whose protection allowed her to live an autonomous, glittering Florentine life apart from her debt-ridden, abusive, playboy husband in Rome. After Cosimo's death in 1574, his spiteful eldest son and heir, Francesco, eager to make his mistress, the first lady of Florence, reneged on the inheritance Cosimo left Isabella and her children and effectively banished her lover from Florence by branding him a murderer. When the treasonous behavior and extramarital affairs of Isabella's sister-in-law Leonora became a symbol for the anarchy of Francesco's court, Francesco sanctioned Leonora's murder at her husband's hands and, soon after, Isabella's murder by her husband as well. Like the Kennedys or Windsors, the Medicis are a dynasty brimming with biographical gold, and this supple, smart account of a lesser-known daughter will engage modern readers as it vivifies both Renaissance Florence and an extraordinary woman who paid the ultimate price for flouting her era's traditional gender roles.

But the very qualities that were repellent in the man make for fascinating reading in Francine du Plessix Gray's biography, <i>At Home with the Marquis de Sade</i>. The pitfalls of writing about such a scandalous subject are obvious: Sade is so completely associated in the modern mind with extremely degrading sexual escapades that any book about him risks being tarred with the same prurient brush--how <i>does</i> one discuss the Marquis without mentioning such loaded topics as whipping, sodomy, masturbation, blasphemy, or orgies, for example? The answer is, one doesn't; but Gray's focus in this biography is less on Sade's sexuality than on his relationship with the two most influential women in his life: his wife, P�lagie, and his mother-in-law, Madame de Montreuil.<p> It seems even a sadist can love, and in his own way, the Marquis de Sade loved his wife. Even more remarkable is that P�lagie apparently returned his affection devotedly for many years, despite frequent scandals, jailings, and even an affair with her own sister. Gray draws extensively on letters written by Sade, his wife, and his mother-in-law to paint a vibrant picture of an unorthodox marriage, a period of great political upheaval, and a complicated bond between mother and daughter. Gray also places the Marquis's writing in a context that, while forthrightly characterizing it as "the crudest, most repellent fictional dystopia ever limned, the creation of a borderline psychotic whose scatological fantasies have grown all the more deranged in the solitude and rage of his jail cell," also acknowledges its "recklessness and daring" as well as its influence on later writers from Swinburne and Baudelaire to Octavio Paz and Luis Bu�uel. Sex, art, religion, and politics--<i>At Home with the Marquis de Sade</i> addresses them all with the intelligence and insight one has come to expect from Francine du Plessix Gray.</p>Francine du Plessix Gray is a regular contributor to the New Yorker, and the author of <i>Rage and Fire</i>, <i>Lovers and Tyrants</i>, and <i>Soviet Women</i>.

This is the New York that Edmund White portrays in <i>City Boy</i>: a place of enormous intrigue and artistic tumult. Combining the no-holds-barred confession and yearning of <i>A Boy's Own Story </i>with the easy erudition and sense of place of <i>The Flaneur</i>, this is the story of White's years in 1970s New York, bouncing from intellectual encounters with Susan Sontag and Harold Brodkey to erotic entanglements downtown to the burgeoning gay scene of artists and writers. I t's a moving, candid, brilliant portrait of a time and place, full of encounters with famous names and cultural icons.</p><p><p>An esteemed novelist and cultural critic, <b>Edmund White </b>is the author of many books, including the autobiographical novel <i>A Boy's Own Story</i>; a previous memoir, <i>My Lives</i>; and most recently a biography of poet Arthur Rimbaud.

There is a great deal of sex and gossip in <i>City Boy</i>, but it is also a minor-key account of Mr. White's coming of age as a writer... <i>City Boy</i> is Mr. White's second memoir in three years, and a great deal of his fiction has been autobiographical. You get the sense of a writer slowly peeling his life like an artichoke, letting only a few stray leaves go at a time... This one is salty and buttery, for sure.

The prolific novelist, critic, memoirist, gay activist, professor and social aspirant has waded into countless literary and intellectual pools and sent visible ripples through each. White's latest book, a ruminative and rambling memoir of his time in New York City in the 1970s, takes readers on a dime tour through the writer's initiation into circles that spun with such blinding talents as Susan Sontag, Richard Howard, John Ashbery, Michel Foucault, even Vladimir Nabokov and Anthony Burgess... <i>City Boy</i> presents an exhilarating sketch of the grizzled, untamed and dangerous way of life that was New York in the 1960s and '70s...

Popular gay historian, novelist, memoirist and survivor Edmund White takes us there in style in <i>City Boy</i>.... In his own classy, restrained, inimitable style, Edmund White presents graceful ruminations on an ungraceful time as one forgotten decade casts a long shadow on the one that followed.

Featuring a new introduction by O'Hara expert and friend, poet and art critic Bill Berkson, <em>Retrieved</em> has been completely reformatted and is essential for any reader of twentieth century poetry. As Berkson writes, "The breadth of what Frank O'Hara took to be poetry is reflected in the many kinds of poems he wrote. . . . Turning the pages of any of his collections, you wonder what he didn't turn his hand to, what variety of poem he left untried or didn't, in some cases, as if in passing, anticipate."</p><p>Among the most significant post-war American poets, <strong>Frank O'Hara</strong> grew up in Grafton, Massachusetts, graduating from Harvard in 1950. After earning an MA at the University of Michigan in 1951, O'Hara moved to New York, where he began working for the Museum of Modern Art and writing for <em>Art News</em>. By 1960, he was named the assistant curator of painting and sculpture exhibitions at MOMA. Along with John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, James Schuyler and Barbara Guest, he is considered an original member of the New York School. Though he died in a tragic accident in 1966, recent references to O'Hara on TV shows like <em>Mad Men</em> or Thurston Moore's new record evidence our culture's continuing fascination with this innovative poet.</p></p><p><p>Frank O'Hara, the son of Russell Joseph O'Hara and Katherine (n�e Broderick) was born on March 27, 1926, at Maryland General Hospital, Baltimore and grew up in Grafton, Massachusetts. He attended St. John's High School in Worcester. He grew up believing he had been born in June, but in fact had been born in March, his parents having disguised his true date of birth because he was conceived out of wedlock. He studied piano at the New England Conservatory in Boston from 1941 to 1944 and served in the South Pacific and Japan as a sonarman on the destroyer USS Nicholas during World War II.</p><p>With the funding made available to veterans he attended Harvard University, where artist and writer Edward Gorey was his roommate. Although O'Hara majored in music and did some composing, his attendance was irregular and his interests disparate. He regularly attended classes in philosophy and theology, while writing impulsively in his spare time. O'Hara was heavily influenced by visual art and by contemporary music, which was his first love (he remained a fine piano player all his life and would often shock new partners by suddenly playing swathes of Rachmaninoff when visiting them). His favorite poets were Arthur Rimbaud, St�phane Mallarm�, Boris Pasternak and Vladimir Mayakovsky. While at Harvard, O'Hara met John Ashbery and began publishing poems in the Harvard Advocate. Despite his love of music, O'Hara changed his major and graduated from Harvard in 1950 with a degree in English.</p><p>He then attended graduate school at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. While at Michigan, he won a Hopwood Award and received his M.A. in English literature in 1951. That autumn O'Hara moved into an apartment in New York City with Joe LeSueur, who would be his roommate and sometime lover for the next 11 years. It was in New York that he began teaching at The New School.</p><p>Known throughout his life for his extreme sociability, passion and warmth, O'Hara had hundreds of friends and lovers throughout his life, many from the New York art and poetry worlds. Soon after arriving in New York, he was employed at the front desk of the Museum of Modern Art and began to write seriously.</p><p>O'Hara was active in the art world, working as a reviewer for Artnews, and in 1960 was Assistant Curator of Painting and Sculpture Exhibitions for the Museum of Modern Art. He was also friends with the artists Willem de Kooning, Norman Bluhm, Larry Rivers and Joan Mitchell.</p><p>In the early morning hours of July 24, 1966, O'Hara was struck by a dune buggy on the Fire Island beach. He died the next day of a ruptured liver. O'Hara was buried in Green River Cemetery on Long Island. The painter Larry Rivers, a longtime friend and lover of O'Hara's, delivered the eulogy.</p><p>"Companion to an earlier volume, <em>Early Writings</em> (1977), and the original <em>Collected Poems</em> (1971), this is a portion of an anticipated complete collected poems of O'Hara. American poet Bill Berkson&#x2019;s introduction comments on O'Hara's self-described act of writing as 'at once as mysterious and practical as there has ever been of the relation of poetry to experience.' VERDICT: Add to the aforementioned companion volumes to create a loose Collected, or let stand as is. Either way retrieve an O&#x2019;Hara collection&#x2014;he's essential."--Annalisa Pesek, <em>Library Journal</em></p><p>"For those of us who adore the meandering colloquialisms of this quintessential New York School poet, finding this trove of drafts and wanderings is an extra treat. O'Hara's inimitable exuberance pushes through, crafting a poetry that can explode out of almost anything, dramatizing the music of thinking. 'The sea was calm and pale. / Almost polite. Whatever / had it meant to us, what / will you mean to me, does / nothing end?' asks O'Hara. He can't answer, of course. Things do end. Thankfully, we get more of him."&#x2014;Tess Taylor, Barnesandnoble.com</p><p>"Scholars and first-time readers will delight in this previously uncollected volume of O'Hara's poems . . . "&#x2014;<em>American Poet</em></p><p>"What we have here is a lot of poetry worth experiencing, and a radiant reminder that the later work is connected to gifts O'Hara displayed as a young man.

Yet no burden here. He wears his erudition and urgency lightly, and his kinetic juxtaposing 'moves' keep startling scholars, fans, and new converts alike. Pleasure morphs with a metaphysical zone as O'Hara's polished surface is cut into deeper to form complex and spirited love poems. They only grow stronger, more mysterious, through vintage time and space. When I met him I saw that jaunty leonine head leading the generous heart 'and my wristwatch became rusty with happiness.'"&#x2014;Anne Waldman, poet and author of <em>The Iovis Trilogy</em></p><p>"While the reputation of many mid-twentieth century poets has declined, Frank O'Hara's keeps rising and rising: today's readers cannot get enough of his brave, jaunty, self-lacerating, funny, poignant, mysterious, and always surprising lyric. <em>Poems Retrieved,</em> originally published in 1977 by the late Don Allen's Grey Fox Press and long out of print, contains more than 200 pages of poems that Allen found after he had assembled the monumental <em>Collected Poems</em> for Alfred A. Knopf in 1971. As Allen noted in his Preface, and as Bill Berkson shows us in his excellent new introduction, these 'poems retrieved,' ranging as they do over O&#x2019;Hara's entire career, are a necessary complement to the <em>Collected,</em> an integral component of the poet's oeuvre. No one interested in O&#x2019;Hara&#x2019;s poetry&#x2014;indeed, no one interested in the poetic ethos of the American 1950s and '60s&#x2014;can afford to be without this volume."&#x2014;Marjorie Perloff, Professor Emerita of English at Stanford University, and author of <em>Frank O&#x2019;Hara: Poet Among Painters</em></p><p>"I'm proud to say that I still have my original copy of <em>Poems Retrieved&nbsp;</em>published by Grey Fox Press in the late 1970's. Many thanks and respect to City Lights, and of course to Donald Allen, for making these wonderful poems, by one of America's very greatest poets, available once again!"&#x2014;Jim Jarmusch, filmmaker</p><p>"The gentle intelligence and hip urbanity that Frank O&#x2019;Hara expressed in his writing, indeed as a person, has nearly vanished, as much as the city that inspired him. His love for the wild vision, in all its artful abstraction, and his erudite passion for the common muse, has proven to be the true resonant poetry of our anxious human condition. We need him."&#x2014;Thurston Moore, musician</p><p>"I can't seem to get ahold of enough Frank O'Hara. <em>Poems Retrieved</em> operates as a kind of further casebook, offering separate luminous slivers of his day to day life. Readers will fill in the gaps themselves through lucid dreaming of Frank. His measure is always gushing forward to float the next incredible image, 'into the hot spring of her blood and her lips, wet with the flavor and the subtle scales, glitter against the horizon.' His colors rise to the surface of our language, etruscan gold split with flashing bolts of violet, and all of this action is still tailored to a very lived in (to die for) tone of voice. <em>Poems Retrieved</em> has been lovingly revamped and now includes a knockout introduction by Bill Berkson. He traces with ease and acuity O'Hara's early fearlessness within forms and his eventual rise to full strength, 'Not that posturing was gone, but that he had realized the postures appropriate for him and the poems.'"&#x2014;Cedar Sigo, author of <em>Stranger in Town</em></p><p>"One of the many pleasures this volume offers is the opportunity to see O'Hara's lightning-quick mind in motion, comparing these newly discovered poems with the O'Hara that we already know. Behind 'The Day Lady Died' lingers the ghost of its beginnings, a tiny poem entitled '[it is 4:19 in Pennsylvania Station]' where we can see O'Hara rehearsing for the great spotlight number to come. <em>Poems Retrieved</em> is a boundless bonanza of O'Hara's version of delight."&#x2014;D.A. Powell, author of <em>Useless Landscape, or A Guide for Boys</em></p><p>"[The poems] like O'Hara (was) are urbane and hip, filled with abstraction, humor, mystery, poignancy and lyricism.

He has written books about bunnies, bears, pigs, dogs, dinosaurs, bullfrogs, sheep, foxes, cows, cats, alligators, mice, and rats. But this is his first book about a gorilla. He lives in Provo, Utah, with whatever people and animals happen to be visiting at the moment. <em>Girl &amp; Gorilla</em> is based on his life. He is Gorilla. </p>PreS-Gr. 2. And go, they do! A family of five bunnies takes twelve different modes of transportation on a cross-country vacation. On each spread a visual clue foretells the next kind of travel, and the last word of the rhyming text is left off, to be revealed on following page. The anticipation and the guessing game work together to forestall questions about the time frame: How long are the bunnies gone? The question is subtly dealt with when the family returns home to find green vines climbing the walls of their home: the potted plant depicted on the opening pages has apparently been growing for some time.

White of the United States. Her books, such as <i>A Southern Garden</i> (1942) and <i>The Little Bulbs</i> (1957), remain in print, continuing to win praise from criticis and to delight an ever-widening circle of readers. In <i>Gardening for Love</i>, Lawrence reveals another world of garden writing, the world of the rural women of the South with whom she corresponded extensively from the late 1950s into the mid-1970s in responce to their advertisements for herbs and ornamental perennials in several market bulletins (published by state departments of agriculture for the benefit of farmers).<br><br>It was Eudora Welty who awakened Elizabeth Lawrence's interest in this fascinating topic by putting her name on the mailing list of <i>The Mississippi Market Bulletin</i>, a twice-monthly collection of classified advertisements founded in 1928 and still published today. Lawrence soon discovered market bulletins from the Carolinas and other Southern states, as well as similar bulletins published privately in the North. She began ordering plants from the bulletins, and there ensued a lively exchange of letters wit the women who sold them.<br><br><i>Gardening for Love</i> is Lawrence's exploration of this little-known side of American horticulture and her affectionate tribute to country people who shared her passion for plants. Drawing on the letters she received, sometimes a great many of them from the same persons over many years, she delves into traditional plant lore, herbal remedies, odd and often highly poetic vernacular plant names peculiar to particular regions of the South, and the herb collectors of the mountains of the Carolinas and Georgia. She focuses primarily on the Southeast and the Deep South, but her wide knowledge of both literature and botany gives <i>Gardening for Love</i> a dimension that transcends the category of regional writing.</p><p>&#34;No American gardening writer has been more admired than the late Elizabeth Lawrence of North Carolina.

Her books&#x2014;<i>A Southern Garden</i>, <i>The Little Bulb</i>s, <i>Gardens in Winter</i>&#x2014;are enlivened by her genius for trading both plants and stories, but this one is particularly enriched by the lively notices from the <i>Mississippi Market Bulletin</i>, a biweekly published by the Mississippi Department of Agriculture that advertised everything from hogs to the bulbs and plants that hard-working farm women hoped to sell for &#x2018;mad&#x2019; money.&#x201d;, <i>Natural History</i><br><br>&#x201c;No American gardening writer has been more admired than the late Elizabeth Lawrence of North Carolina.

Just as Eudora Welty&#x2014;the friend who first interested Elizabeth Lawrence in the <i>Mississippi Market Bulletin</i>&#x2014; has the voice and feel of her native Jackson, Mississippi, so Lawrence has an intimate knowledge of her home soil.<br>&#x201c;But her scope, just like Welty&#x2019;s, stretches far and deep, reaching into the hearts of not only gardeners, but any reader fascinated with the comings and goings of the human race. . . .

In this book, Moominpappa has written his autobiography of his amazing life, and he tells it to his son Moomintroll, and to Moomintroll&#39;s friends, Sniff and Snufkin. In his tale, he at first was left at an orphanage, but after finding it boring and disliking the strict headmistress Hemulen, he leaves and meets a new friend, Hodgkin. Hodgkin and Moominpappa meet the Joxter (Snufkin&#39;s father) and the Muddler (Sniff&#39;s father). Together they build a boat, in which to live. They fool the enormous Edward the Booble into helping to set the ship off. After realising their trickery he becomes very angry, but they sail away. They rescue a Hemulen from being eaten by a Groke, however the Hemulen is very bossy, and soon they abandon her with the Niblings. One young Nibling stows aboard their ship, and travels with them. They eventually reach a far away land, where they meet the Mymble family. The Mymble&#39;s daughter befriends them and together they go to Daddy Jones (the King&#39;s) 100th birthday party where they all win prizes. They then set up new homes on an island, however are spooked by the island ghost. They manage to make a deal with the ghost, and they befriend him. Meanwhile, Hodgkins has designed the Amphibian - a sort of land/sea ship for Daddy Jones. On its maiden voyage, it is attacked by a giant fish, but they are saved when Edward the Booble steps on the fish. The Muddler then marries the Fuzzy, and Moominpappa rescues another Moomin and her handbag from the sea. She turns out to be Moominmamma. The story ends, and links chronologically with &#34;The Moomins and the Great Flood&#34;.</p><p></p><h2>Victoria: A Life</h2><p><b><br>PEN/Jacqueline Bograd Weld Award for Biography (2015 LONGLIST)<br><br>"[A] shimmering and rather wonderful biography."--<i>The Guardian </i>(UK)</b><br><br> When Queen Victoria died in 1901, she had ruled for nearly sixty-four years. She was a mother of nine and grandmother of forty-two and the matriarch of royal Europe through her children&#x2019;s marriages. To many, Queen Victoria is a ruler shrouded in myth and mystique, an aging, stiff widow paraded as the figurehead to an all-male imperial enterprise. But in truth, Britain&#x2019;s longest-reigning monarch was one of the most passionate, expressive, humorous and unconventional women who ever lived, and the story of her life continues to fascinate.<br><br> A. N. Wilson&#x2019;s exhaustively researched and definitive biography includes a wealth of new material from previously unseen sources to show us Queen Victoria as she&#x2019;s never been seen before. Wilson explores the curious set of circumstances that led to Victoria&#x2019;s coronation, her strange and isolated childhood, her passionate marriage to Prince Albert and his pivotal influence even after death and her widowhood and subsequent intimate friendship with her Highland servant John Brown, all set against the backdrop of this momentous epoch in Britain&#x2019;s history&#x2014;and the world&#x2019;s.<br><br> Born at the very moment of the expansion of British political and commercial power across the globe, Victoria went on to chart a unique course for her country even as she became the matriarch of nearly every great dynasty of Europe. Her destiny was thus interwoven with those of millions of people&#x2014;not just in Europe but in the ever-expanding empire that Britain was becoming throughout the nineteenth century. The famed queen had a face that adorned postage stamps, banners, statues and busts all over the known world.<br><br> Wilson&#x2019;s <i>Victoria</i> is a towering achievement, a masterpiece of biography by a writer at the height of his powers.<br><br>*<b>VICTORIA</b>, an eight part miniseries about Queen Victoria is coming to PBS in the Downton Abbey slot, premiering<b>January 8th&nbsp;</b>(trailer).

Was he really the son of God? Were the Jews culpable in his death? These ancient questions have been debated for almost two thousand years, most recently with the release of Mel Gibson&#x2019;s explosive <i>The Passion of the Christ</i>. The controversy was never merely academic. The legal status and security of Jews&#x2014;often their very lives&#x2014;depended on the answer. <br><br>In WHY THE JEWS REJECTED JESUS, David Klinghoffer reveals that the Jews since ancient times accepted not only the historical existence of Jesus but the role of certain Jews in bringing about his crucifixion and death. But he also argues that they had every reason to be skeptical of claims for his divinity. <br><br>For one thing, Palestine under Roman occupation had numerous charismatic would-be messiahs, so Jesus would not have been unique, nor was his following the largest of its kind. For another, the biblical prophecies about the coming of the Messiah were never fulfilled by Jesus, including an ingathering of exiles, the rise of a Davidic king who would defeat Israel&#x2019;s enemies, the building of a new Temple, and recognition of God by the gentiles. Above all, the Jews understood their biblically commanded way of life, from which Jesus&#x2019;s followers sought to &#x201c;free&#x201d; them, as precious, immutable, and eternal.<br><br>Jews have long been blamed for Jesus&#x2019;s death and stigmatized for rejecting him. But Jesus lived and died a relatively obscure figure at the margins of Jewish society. Indeed, it is difficult to argue that &#x201c;the Jews&#x201d; of his day rejected Jesus at all, since most Jews had never heard of him. The figure they really rejected, often violently, was Paul, who convinced the Jerusalem church led by Jesus&#x2019;s brother to jettison the observance of Jewish law. Paul thus founded a new religion. If not for him, Christianity would likely have remained a Jewish movement, and the course of history itself would have been changed. Had the Jews accepted Jesus, Klinghoffer speculates, Christianity would not have conquered Europe, and there would be no Western civilization as we know it. <br><br>WHY THE JEWS REJECTED JESUS tells the story of this long, acrimonious, and occasionally deadly debate between Christians and Jews. It is thoroughly engaging, lucidly written, and in many ways highly original. Though written from a Jewish point of view, it is also profoundly respectful of Christian sensibilities. Coming at a time when Christians and Jews are in some ways moving closer than ever before, this thoughtful and provocative book represents a genuine effort to heal the ancient rift between these two great faith traditions.</p></p><p><p>The age-old debate about Jewish culpability in the death of Christ was seemingly put to rest. The recent furor surrounding Mel Gibson&#x2019;s <i>The Passion of the Christ</i>, however, has reopened the wound, and many fear that it will undermine a century of Jewish-Christian dialogue. David Klinghoffer brings a fresh perspective to the claims and counterclaims in this authoritative reexamination of the origin of the controversy and its impact on history. <br><br>Far from denying the role Jews played in the crucifixion, Klinghoffer provides ample evidence that Jewish sages accepted full responsibility for it. Exposed to many would-be messiahs, the Jews of Palestine regarded Jesus with a sense of curiosity tempered by understandable skepticism. Opposition to him arose not in response to his rebellious activities but to his individualistic, often unorthodox, interpretations of the law. According to Biblical prophesies, the coming of the Messiah would be marked by a series of specific events, including the gathering of exiles, the return of a Davidic king, and the reconstruction of the Temple. Because none of these events occurred during Jesus&#x2019; lifetime, Klinghoffer argues, the judgment against Jesus by Jewish elders was natural and inevitable. In condemning Jesus, they were upholding a basic tenet of their religion: the belief that no man could interpret the Torah on his own authority. <br><br>The Jerusalem Church established by Jesus&#x2019; followers remained a wholly Jewish movement. In a persuasive, groundbreaking conclusion, Klinghoffer shows that the schism between Judaism and Christianity was a result not of the Jewish rejection of Jesus but of the rejection of Paul. Claiming that Christ transcended the written Torah, Paul&#x2019;s preachings clearly represented a new religion&#x2014;one that would spread throughout Europe and change the course of history.</p><p>David Klinghoffer, a columnist for the Jewish <i>Forward</i>, is the author of in <i>The Lord Will Gather Me In</i> and <i>The Discovery of God: Abraham and the Birth of Monotheism</i>.

We often overlook the historical link between mathematics and technological advances, says Stewart--but this connection is integral to any complete understanding of human history.Equations are modeled on the patterns we find in the world around us, says Stewart, and it is through equations that we are able to make sense of, and in turn influence, our world. Stewart locates the origins of each equation he presents--from Pythagoras&#39;s Theorem to Newton&#39;s Law of Gravity to Einstein&#39;s Theory of Relativity--within a particular historical moment, elucidating the development of mathematical and philosophical thought necessary for each equation&#39;s discovery. None of these equations emerged in a vacuum, Stewart shows; each drew, in some way, on past equations and the thinking of the day. In turn, all of these equations paved the way for major developments in mathematics, science, philosophy, and technology. Without logarithms (invented in the early 17th century by John Napier and improved by Henry Briggs), scientists would not have been able to calculate the movement of the planets, and mathematicians would not have been able to develop fractal geometry. The Wave Equation is one of the most important equations in physics, and is crucial for engineers studying the vibrations in vehicles and the response of buildings to earthquakes. And the equation at the heart of Information Theory, devised by Claude Shannon, is the basis of digital communication today. An approachable and informative guide to the equations upon which nearly every aspect of scientific and mathematical understanding depends, In Pursuit of the Unknown is also a reminder that equations have profoundly influenced our thinking and continue to make possible many of the advances that we take for granted.</p><p>Publishers Weekly &#34;Stewart shares his enthusiasm as well as his knowledge in this tour of ground-breaking equations and the research they supported....

Following his childhood passion, he entered the fledgling aircraft industry as an aeronautical engineer working to develop airships and, later, airplanes. In his spare time he began writing and he published his first novel, <i>Marazan</i>, in 1926, using the name Nevil Shute to protect his engineering career. In 1931 he married Frances Mary Heaton and they had two daughters. During the Second World War he joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve where he worked on developing secret weapons.

This collection is divided into two sections: the first features eloquent sketches of the West's history and environment, directing our imagination to the sublime beauty of such places as San Juan and Glen Canyon; the concluding section examines the state of Western literature, of the mythical past versus the diminished present, and analyzes the difficulties facing any contemporary Western writer. <b>The Sound of Mountain Water</b> is both a hymn to the Western landscape, an affirmation of the hope embodied therein, and a careful investigation of the West's cultural and natural legacy.</p><p><b>Wallace Stegner</b> (1909&#x2013;1993) was the author of, among other novels,<i> All the Little Live Things</i> (winner of a Commonwealth Club Gold Medal),&nbsp;<i>Angle of Repose</i> (winner of the Pulitzer Prize), and&nbsp;<i>The Spectator Bird</i> (winner of the National Book Award).

Since then over 200 discrete reasons have been advanced for the collapse of the western half of the Roman empire. Until very recently, the academic view downplayed the death and destruction, to spin a positive story of the &#39;world of late antiquity&#39;. Barbarian invasions are described in neutral language: the movement of peoples. It is all painfully &#39;politically correct&#39;. Now Adrian Goldsworthy comes forward with his trademark combination of clear narrative, common sense, and a thorough mastery of the sources. In telling the story from beginning to end, he rescues the era from the mealy-mouthed and diffident: this is a red-blooded account of barbarian invasions, palace coups, scheming courtiers and corrupt emperors who set the gold standard for dissipation. It is &#39;old fashioned history&#39; in the best sense: an accessible narrative with colourful characters whose story reveals the true reasons for the fall of Rome.</p><p>Adrian Goldsworthy has a doctorate from Oxford University. His first book, The Roman Army at War was recognised by John Keegan, the general Editor of The History of Warfare, as an exceptionally impressive work, original in treatment and impressive in style. His other books include The Punic Wars, and the volume on Roman Warfare in John Keegan�s Cassell History of Warfare series. He has lectured on Roman history in both the UK and USA.&#34;the implication of of Goldworthy&#39;s book is that we are now living in a modern version of a late-Roman world - and one about to collapse.&#34; -- MARY BEARD, SUNDAY TIMES &#34;Goldsworthy ponders why Rome eventually fell and points to the increasing and obsessive bureaucratisation of the government, the self-interest of political leaders and the target-oriented culture of the state.&#34; THES &#34;Both as a narrative history of the western empire&#39;s last years and as an analysis of events this book is an invaluable read for anyone interested in later Roman History.&#34; -- Philip Matyszak www.unrv.com</p><h2>Metamorphoses (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p><em>Metamorphoses</em>--the best-known poem by one of the wittiest poets of classical antiquity--takes as its theme change and transformation, as illustrated by Greco-Roman myth and legend.

It is a rare achievement."--Richard P. Martin, <em>Princeton University</em><p></p><br>"An excellent translation, elegant and accurate."--Simone Turbeville, <em>University of Texas, Arlington</em><p></p><br>"Melville has chosen blank verse, pleasantly varied by rhymed couplets to round off each sequence. His narrative is taut...his vocabulary vivid and flexible, his speeches pungent or powerful, and his command of wit a delight."--<em>Classical Review</em><p></p><br>"If Ovid wanted to read himself in English, he should certainly be happy with Melville's translation, which eloquently captures a great deal of his urbanity, wit, and sentiment in an expressive blank verse that is itself a bit of a wonder."--Thomas Clayton, Chairman, <em>University of Minnesota</em><p></p><br>"The translation is readable and tells the tales with charm, and the notes are truly excellent."--Carol R.

In the autumn of 1863, Violet Hennessey, a seemingly nervous young woman, seeks refuge from rampaging bushwhackers with 11-year-old Peg Kelly's family in their St. Joseph, Missouri, home. Peg is preoccupied with trying to be as brave as her brothers and sisters and is drawn to the visitor who treats her as an adult. However, Peg finds many of Violet's actions puzzling, and begins to wonder if she is a Confederate spy. Violet is, in fact, a Union spy, and by the end of this tale, Peg has helped her transmit information vital to breaking the siege of Chattanooga; Violet's brother-in-law has been shot by bushwhackers; and Peg's brother Danny is dead of a fever, which worsened after he left his sickbed to save his sister and Violet from violence at the hands of Confederate sympathizers. Unfortunately, the characters are all one-dimensional. Although Peg professes an ardent desire to grow up, in these pages she does not grow but simply and automatically reacts to the situations in which she is placed.

Why was President Nixon willing to risk his reelection with so many repeated burglaries at the Watergate and other Washington offices in just a few weeks? What motivated Nixon to jeopardize his presidency by ordering the wide range of criminal operations that resulted in Watergate? What was Nixon so desperate to get at the Watergate, and how does it explain the deeper context surrounding his crimes?<br><br>For the first time, the groundbreaking investigative research in <i>Watergate: The Hidden History</i> provides documented answers to all of those questions. It adds crucial missing pieces to the Watergate story information that President Nixon wanted, but couldn&#x2019;t get, and that wasn&#x2019;t available to the Senate Watergate Committee or to Woodward and Bernstein. This new information not only reveals remarkable insights into Nixon&#x2019;s motivation for Watergate, but also answers the two most important remaining questions: What were the Watergate burglars after? And why was Nixon willing to risk his Presidency to get it?<br><br><i>Watergate: The Hidden History</i> reexamines the historical record, including new material only available in recent years. This includes thousands of recently declassified CIA and FBI files, newly released Nixon tapes, and exclusive interviews with those involved in the events surrounding Watergate ranging from former Nixon officials to key aides for John and Robert Kennedy. This book also builds on decades of investigations by noted journalists and historians, as well as long-overlooked investigative articles from publications like <i>Time</i> magazine, the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and the <i>New York Times</i>.<br></p><p><b>Lamar Waldron's</b> historical research and nonfiction books have won praise from <i>Publishers Weekly, Vanity Fair</i>, the <i>Boston Globe</i>, the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, and major publications in Europe.

This collection of quotes shares her thoughts on marriage, family, political life and ambition, publicity, privacy, and more as she confided them to intimate friends, family, and interviewers alike.</p><p>Memories of her childhood, her love for Jack, her children and grandchildren, the Kennedys, her often misunderstood marriage to Aristotle Onassis, her years as a widow, and her later companionship with Maurice Tempelsman are all represented here, as are some rather remarkable correspondences with the Johnsons, the Nixons, and the Khrushchevs.</p><p>A sampling of her wit and wisdom:</p><p></p><ul> <li>"I was a tomboy. I decided to learn to dance and I became feminine."</li><p></p><p> </p><li>"Well, I think my biggest achievement is that, after going through a rather difficult time, I consider myself comparatively sane."</li><p></p><p> </p><li>"When Harvard men say they have graduated from Radcliffe, then we've made it."</li><p></p><p> </p><li>"If Jack proved to be the greatest president of the century and his children turned out badly, it would be a tragedy." </li></ul><p></p><p>Forty years ago, when the nation was coming out from under a period of mourning, Bill Adler edited <em>The Kennedy Wit</em> and in so doing helped the world remember a man and a president, not just a sorrowful event. To commemorate the tenth anniversary of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's death, he has edited yet another book of quotes celebrating life -- this time the life of Jackie.</p><p>The accompanying DVD documentary is considered by many to be the definitive film biography of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and was produced by CBS News Productions for Arts &amp; Entertainment Network.</p></p><p><p>Bill Adler is the editor of four <em>New York Times</em> bestselling books, including<em> The Kennedy Wit,</em> and is also the president of Bill Adler Books, Inc., a New York literary agency whose clients have included Mike Wallace, Dan Rather, President George W. Bush, Bob Dole, Larry King, and Nancy Reagan.</p>Eloquent is a strong word to apply to this collection of musings and quotes. Adler, editor of the bestselling The Kennedy Wit: The Humor and Wisdom of John F. Kennedy, has vacuumed up excerpts from Onassis&#x2019;s letters, speeches and interviews along with recollected verbal asides to friends, heads of state and hairdressers, and has even included a portion of her will. The results are uninspiring. Onassis reflects on politics ("We should all do something to right the wrongs that we see and not just complain about them"), the arts ("Poets are the ones who change the world"), motherhood ("The things you do with your children you never forget") and the White House ("It&#x2019;s like a hotel. Everywhere I look there is somebody standing around or walking down a hall"). Unsurprisingly, many of the snippets herein concern John F. Kennedy: she notes that "Jack was something special, and I know he saw something special in me too"; "My life revolves around my husband"; "I never told him anything or showed him anything unpleasant"; and "I would certainly not express any view that was not my husband&#x2019;s." To her mother, she reportedly said that JFK "didn&#x2019;t even have the satisfaction of being killed for civil rights. It had to be some silly little communist." Other bon mots include "The first time you marry for love, the second for money, and the third for companionship" and "I do love to live in style." The portrait that emerges is not a flattering one. But that may be a fault of the volume rather than its subject. Who among us would like to be remembered through a smattering of interview snippets and off-the-cuff remarks? Photos.

Tapply was the author of dozens of books, including more than two dozen New England-based mystery novels and nearly a thousand magazine articles, mostly about fly fishing and the outdoors. Tapply died in July 2009 after a battle with Leukemia. He lived and wrote in Hancock, New Hampshire.Tapply toys with but never fully explores the metaphor of the hunter and the hunted in lawyer/sleuth Brady Coyne's 10th outing. Professional hunter Jeff Newton has lived as an embittered and near-friendless invalid since being attacked by a wounded leopard in Africa. Brady, his lawyer, is visiting him on Cape Cod when Newton's seven solid-gold pre-Columbian jaguar statuettes given to Newton by a Mayan chief as reward for slaying the wild cat that mauled his son, are stolen. Brady is knocked out after the crooks superficially slit his throat and Jeff, bashed in the head, falls into a coma. Only Lily, Jeff's seductive, lonely, longtime housekeeper, remains unharmed. Enraged by the attack, Brady hunts for the thieves, his search eventually taking him to Montana, where the crime is resolved. While Tapply ( Dead Meat ) writes dialogue with Spartan economy, Brady's tendency to ruminate--about fishing or about his personal ambivalences--diminishes the impact of his character. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Property Management</h2><p>Rockwell Publishing&#39;s Property Management is a comprehensive introduction to managing investment real estate, including residential properties (apartment buildings and single-family rental homes) and commercial properties (office, retail, and industrial space).

But young Jody Baxter is not content with these electrifying escapades, or even with the cozy comfort of home with Pa and Ma. He wants a pet, a friend with whom he can share his quiet cogitations and his corn pone. Jody gets his pet, a frisky fawn he calls Flag, but that's not all. With Flag comes a year of life lessons, frolicking times, and achingly hard decisions. This powerful book is as compelling now as when it was written over 60 years ago. Read simply as a naturalist study of the Florida interior, it fascinates and entices. Add the heart-stopping adventure and heart-wrenching human elements, and this is a classic well worth its Pulitzer Prize. Earthy dialect and homespun wisdom season the story, giving it a unique and unforgettable flavor, and N.C. Wyeth's warm, soft illustrations capture an era of rough subsistence and sweet survival. (Ages 12 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i>In this classic story of the Baxter family of inland Florida and their wild, hard, satisfying life, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings has written one of the great novels of our times. A rich and varied story - tender in its understanding of boyhood, crowded with the excitement of the backwoods hunt, with vivid descriptions of the primitive, beautiful hammock country, with humor and earthy philosophy - <i>The Yearling</i> is a novel for readers of all tastes and ages. Its glowing picture of life that is far and refreshingly removed from modern patterns of living becomes universal in its revelation of simple courageous people and the abiding beliefs they live by. Winner of Pulitzer Prize in 1938, <i>The Yearling</i> was made available the following year in a special edition illustrated by the distinguished American artist, N.C. Wyeth. The original paintings have been re-photographed and new plates made for this handsome volume.END</p><h2>Curiouser: On The Queerness Of Children</h2><p>Our culture has a dominant narrative about children: they are (and should stay) innocent of sexual desires and intentions. At the same time, children are officially, tacitly, assumed to be heterosexual. Curiouser is a book about this narrative and what happens when it takes an unexpected, or queer, turn-when the stories of childhood must confront a child whose play does not conform to the ideal of child (a)sexuality.The contributors to Curiouser examine the ostensibly simple representations of children that circulate through visual images, life narrative, children&#39;s literature, film, and novels. At issue in these essays are the stories we tell to children, the stories we tell about children, and the stories we tell ourselves as children-stories that ultimately frame what is normative and what is queer. From the fiction of Horatio Alger, Henry James, Djuna Barnes, and Guy Davenport to the spectacles of Michael Jackson, Calvin Klein, and The Exorcist; from the narrative structure of pedophilia to evangelical Christianity; from punk tomboyism to queer girl-scouting: these scholars of childhood and sexuality scrutinize queer childhood energies in an impressive range of cultural forms.Contributors: Lauren Berlant, U of Chicago; Andre Furlani, Concordia U; Judith Halberstam, U of California, San Diego; Ellis Hanson, Cornell U; Paul Kelleher; Kathryn Kent, Williams College; James Kincaid, U of Southern California; Richard Mohr, U of Illinois, Urbana; Michael Moon, Johns Hopkins U; Kevin Ohi, Boston College; Eric Savoy, U of Montreal; Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, CUNY Graduate Center; Kathryn Bond Stockton, U of Utah; Michael Warner, Rutgers U.Steven Bruhm is associate professor of English at Mount St. Vincent University.

Now Arthur Bryant and John May return in a case of multiple murder that twists through a subterranean course of the secrets, lies, and extreme passions that drive even ordinary men and women to the most shocking crimes....<br><br>They are living legends with a reputation for solving even the trickiest cases using unorthodox, unconventional, and often completely unauthorized methods. But the Peculiar Crimes Unit headed by Detectives John May and Arthur Bryant is one mistake away from being shut down for good. And when the elderly sister of Bryant&#x2019;s friend is found dead in the basement of her decrepit house in Kentish Town, they find themselves on the verge of making exactly that mistake.<br><br>According to the coroner, Ruth Singh&#x2019;s heart simply stopped beating. But why was a woman who rarely left the house fully dressed for an outing? And why was there river water in her throat? Convinced that the old lady didn&#x2019;t die a natural death, the detectives delve into a murky case with no apparent motive, no forensics, and no clues. And they&#x2019;ve barely launched their investigation when death claims another victim. Suddenly they discover some very unnatural behavior surrounding Ruth Singh&#x2019;s death by &#x201c;natural&#x201d; causes&#x2014;from shady real estate developers and racist threats to two troubled marriages, from a dodgy academician working London&#x2019;s notorious &#x201c;grey economy&#x201d; to a network of antiquities collectors obsessed with Egyptian mythology. And running beneath it all are the sweeping tentacles of London&#x2019;s vast and forgotten underground river system. As the rains pour down and the water rises, Bryant and May must rely on instinct, experience, and their own very peculiar methods to stem a tide of evil that threatens to drown them all.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>Christopher Fowler is the acclaimed author of twelve previous novels, including the first Bryant &amp; May novel, <b>Full Dark House.</b> He lives in London, where he is at work on his third novel featuring Arthur Bryant and John May.Chapter One<br><i><br><br>A change in the weather<br></i><br>Arthur Bryant looked out over London and remembered.<br><br>Fierce sunlight swathed Tower Bridge beyond the rockeries of smouldering bomb-sites. A Thames sailing barge was arriving in the Pool of London with a cargo of palm kernels. Its dusty red sails sagged in the afternoon heat as it drifted past Broadway Dock at Limehouse, like a felucca on the Nile. Dairy horses trotted along the deserted Embankment, empty milk cans chiming behind them. Children swam from the wharves below St Paul&#x2019;s, while carping mothers fanned away stale air from the river steps. He could smell horse dung and tobacco, meadow grass, the river. The world had once moved forward in single paces.<br><br>The vision wavered and vanished, displaced by sun-flares from the sealed glass corridors of the new city.<br><br>The old man in the unravelling sepia scarf waited for the rest of the party to gather around him. It was a Saturday afternoon at the start of October, and London&#x2019;s thirteen-week heatwave was about to end with a vengeance. Already, the wind had changed direction, stippling the surface of the river with grey goose-pimples. Above the spire of St Paul&#x2019;s, patulous white clouds deepened to a shade reminiscent of overwashed socks. The enervating swelter was giving way to a cool breeze, sharp in the shadows. The change had undermined his group&#x2019;s stamina, reducing their numbers to a handful, although four polite but puzzled Japanese boys had joined thinking they were on the Jack the Ripper tour. Once everyone had settled, the elderly guide began the last section of his talk.<br><br>&#x2018;Ladies and gentlemen . . .&#x2019; He gave them the benefit of the doubt. &#x2018;If you would care to gather a little closer.&#x2019; Arthur Bryant raised his voice as a red wall of buses rumbled past. &#x2018;We are now standing on Blackfriars&#x2014;formerly Pitt&#x2014;Bridge.&#x2019; Remember to use the hands, he told himself. Keep their interest. &#x2018;Bridges are causeways across great divides, in this case the rich city on the north side&#x2014;&#x2019;hand usage to indicate north&#x2014;&#x2018;and the more impoverished south side. Does anyone have a Euro note in their pocket? Take it out and you&#x2019;ll find a bridge, the universal symbol for something that unites and strengthens.&#x2019; He paused, less for effect than to catch his breath. Bryant really had no need to freelance as a city tour guide. His detective duties at the London Peculiar Crimes Unit would have kept a man half his age working late. But he enjoyed contact with the innocent public; most of the civilians he met in his day job were under criminal suspicion. Explaining the city to strangers calmed him down, even helped him to understand himself.<br><br>He pulled his ancient scarf tighter and abandoned his set text. What the hell, they were the last group of the season, and had proven pretty unresponsive. &#x2018;According to Disraeli,&#x2019; he announced, &#x2018; &#x201c;London is a nation, not a city.&#x201d; &#x201c;That great cesspool into which all the loungers of the Empire are irresistibly drained,&#x201d; said Conan Doyle. &#x201c;No duller spectacle on earth than London on a rainy Sunday afternoon,&#x201d; according to De Quincey, so take your pick. One of the planet&#x2019;s great crossing-points, it has more languages, religions and newspapers than any other place on earth. We divide into tribes according to age, wealth, class, race, religion, taste and personality, and this diversity breeds respect.&#x2019; Two members of the group nodded and repeated the word &#x2018;diversity&#x2019;, like an Oxford Street language class. God, this lot&#x2019;s hard work, thought Bryant. I&#x2019;m gasping for a cup of tea.<br><br>&#x2018;London&#x2019;s main characteristic is an absence of form. Its thirty-three boroughs have busy districts running through them like veins, with no visible hierarchy, and neighbourhood ties remain inexplicably close. Because Londoners have a strongly pronounced sense of home, where you live counts more than who you are.&#x2019; Bryant mostly lived inside his head. Remember the facts, he told himself, they like facts.<br><br>&#x2018;We have six royal parks, 160 theatres, 8,600 restaurants, 300 museums and around 30,000 shops. Over 3,500 criminal offences are reported every day. Poverty and wealth exist side by side, often in the same street. Bombings caused slum clearance and social housing, rupturing centuries-old barriers of class, turning the concept into something mysterious and ever-shifting. London is truly unknowable.&#x2019;<br><br>Bryant looked past his under-dressed audience to the swirling brown river. The Japanese boys were bored and cold, and had started taking pictures of litter bins. One of them was listening to music. &#x2018;A city of cruelty and kindness, stupidity and excess, extremes and paradoxes,&#x2019; he told them, raising his voice. &#x2018;Almost half of all journeys through the metropolis are made on foot. A city of glass, steel, water and flesh that no longer smells of beer and brick, but piss and engines.&#x2019;<br><br>He lifted his silver-capped walking stick to the sky. &#x2018;The arches of London&#x2019;s Palladian architecture lift and curve in secular harmonies. Walls of glass reflect wet pavements in euphonious cascades of rain.&#x2019; He was no longer addressing the group, but voicing his thoughts. &#x2018;We&#x2019;re heading for winter, when a caul of sluggishness deepens into thanatomimesis, the state of being mistaken for death. But the city never dies; it just lies low. Its breath grows shallow in the cold river air while housebound tenants, flu-ridden and fractious with the perpetual motion of indoor activity, recover and grow strong once more. London and its people are parasites trapped in an ever-evolving symbiosis. At night the residents lose their carapace of gentility, bragging and brawling through the streets. The old London emerges, dancing drunk skeletons leaving graveyard suburbs to terrify the faint of heart.&#x2019;<br><br>Now even the hardiest listeners looked confused. They spoke to each other in whispers and shook their heads. Their guide seemed to be straying from his topic: &#x2018;A Historic Thameside Walk&#x2019;. The Japanese boys gave up and wandered off. Someone said, rather loudly, &#x2018;This tour was much better last time. There was a caf�.&#x2019;<br><br>Bryant carried on, regardless.<br><br>&#x2018;London no longer suffers from the weight of its past. Now only the faintest resonance of legendary events remains. Oh, I can show you balustrades, pillars and scrollwork, point out sites of religious and political interest, streets that have witnessed great events, but to be honest there&#x2019;s bugger all to see. It&#x2019;s impossible to imagine the lives of those who came before us. Our visible history has been rubbed to a trace, like graffiti scrubbed from Portland stone. London has reinvented itself more completely than ever. And whoever grows up here becomes a part of its human history.&#x2019;<br><br>He had completely lost his listeners. They were complaining to each other in dissatisfaction and disarray. &#x2018;That concludes the tour for today,&#x2019; he added hastily. &#x2018;I think we&#x2019;ll skip question time, you&#x2019;ve been a truly dreadful audience.&#x2019; He decided not to bother with his tip box as the mystified, grumbling group was forced to disperse across the windy bridge.<br><br>Bryant looked toward the jumble of outsized apartment buildings being constructed at the edge of the Thames, the yellow steel cranes clustered around them like praying mantises. After so many years in the service, he was quick to sense approaching change. Another wave of executives was colonizing the riverbank, creating a new underclass. He wondered how soon the invasion would provoke fresh forms of violence.<br><br>It&#x2019;s metabolizing quickly, he thought. How long before it becomes unrecognizable? How can I hope to understand it for much longer?<br><br>He turned up his collar as he passed the urban surfers of the South Bank car park. The clatter of their skateboards bounced between the concrete arcades like the noise of shunting trains. Kids always found ways to occupy ignored spaces. He emerged into daylight and paced at the river rail, studying the evolving skyline of the Thames.<br><br>Hardly anything left of my childhood memories.<br><br>The Savoy, St Paul&#x2019;s, the spire of St Bride&#x2019;s, a few low monuments palisaded by international banks as anonymous as cigarette boxes.

He&#x2019;s known for his economical prose, and the shortest-of-short stories is, at the very least, emblematic of his style.<br> <br>Hemingway&#x2019;s simple style was an intentional choice. He once wrote in a letter to his editor, &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t by accident that the Gettysburg address was so short. The laws of prose writing are as immutable as those of flight, of mathematics, of physics.&#x201d; He believed that writing should be cut down to the bare essentials and that extra words end up hurting the final product.<br> <br>Ernest Hemingway is far from alone in this belief. The same idea is raised in high-school classrooms and writing guides of every variety. And if there&#x2019;s one part of speech that&#x2019;s the worst offender of all, as anyone who&#x2019;s ever had an exacting English teacher will know, it&#x2019;s the adverb.<br> <br>After listening to enough experts and admirers, it&#x2019;s easy to come away with the impression that Hemingway is the paragon of concision. But is this because he succeeded where others were tempted by extraneous language, or is he coasting on reputation alone? Where does Hemingway rank, for instance, in his use of the dreaded adverb?<br> <br>I wanted to find out if he lived up to the hype. And if not, who does use the fewest adverbs? Which author uses them the most? Moreover, when we look at the big picture, can we find out whether great writing does indeed hew to those efficient &#x201c;laws of prose writing&#x201d;? Do the best books use fewer adverbs?<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>I looked around and found that no one had ever attempted to determine the numbers behind these questions. So I sought to find some answers&#x2014;and I started by analyzing the almost one million words in Hemingway&#x2019;s ten published novels.<br> <br>If Hemingway believes that the &#x201c;laws of prose writing are as immutable as those of flight, of mathematics, of physics,&#x201d; then I&#x2019;d like to think he&#x2019;d find this mathematical analysis equal parts illuminating and outlandish.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s outlandish at first glance because of the way we study writing. Many of us have spent days in middle school, high school, and college English classrooms dissecting a single striking excerpt from a Hemingway novel. If you want to study a great author&#x2019;s writing, their most remembered passages are often the best place to start. Looking at a spreadsheet of adverb frequencies, on the other hand, won&#x2019;t teach you much in the way of writing a novel like Hemingway.<br> <br>But from a statistician&#x2019;s point of view, it&#x2019;s just as outlandish to focus on a small sample and never look at the whole picture. When you study the population of the United States, you wouldn&#x2019;t look at just the population of a small town in New Hampshire for an understanding of the entire country, no matter how emblematic of the American spirit it may seem. If you want to know how Hemingway writes, you also need to understand the words he chooses that have not been put under the microscope. By looking at adverb rates throughout all his books, we can get a better sense of how he used language.<br> <br>So instead of digging through snippets of Hemingway&#x2019;s text and debating specific spots where he chose to use or shirk adverbs, I used a set of functions called Natural Language Toolkit to count the number of adverbs in all of his novels. The toolkit relies on specific words and the relationships between them to tag words with a part of speech. For example, here&#x2019;s how it processes the previous sentence:<br> <br><br> <br>It&#x2019;s not 100 % perfect&#x2014;so all the numbers below should be seen with that wrinkle in mind&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s been trained on millions of human-analyzed texts and fares as well as any person could be expected to do. It&#x2019;s considered the gold standard in sussing out if a word is an adjective, adverb, personal pronoun, or any other part of speech.<br> <br>So what do we find when we apply the toolkit to Hemingway&#x2019;s complete works?<br> <br>In all of Hemingway&#x2019;s novels, he wrote just over 865,000 words and used 50,200 adverbs, putting his adverb use at about 5.8 % of all words. On average, for every 17 words Hemingway wrote, one of them was an adverb.<br> <br>This number without context has no meaning. Is 5.8 % a lot or a little? Stephen King, an outspoken critic of adverbs, has a usage rate of 5.5 %.<br> <br>It turns out that by this standard King and Hemingway are not leaps and bounds ahead of other writers. Looking at a handful of contemporary authors who one might assume (based on stereotype alone) would use an abundance of adverbs, we see that King and Hemingway are not anomalous. E L James, author of the erotica novel Fifty Shades of Grey, used adverbs at a rate of 4.8 %. Stephenie Meyer, whom King has called &#x201c;not very good,&#x201d; used adverbs at a rate of 5.7 % in her Twilight books, putting her right between the horror master and the legendary Hemingway.<br> <br>Expanding our search, Hemingway used more adverbs than authors John Steinbeck and Kurt Vonnegut. He used more adverbs than children&#x2019;s authors Roald Dahl and R.L. Stine. And, yes, the master of simple prose used more adverbs than Stephenie Meyer and E L James.<br> <br>All the sentences above are true&#x2014;but they also need a giant asterisk next to them and a full explanation. Because the answer is not as simple as the numbers above first suggest.<br> <br>Those tallies are counts of total adverb usage. An adverb is any word that modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb&#x2014;and no adverbs were excluded or excused. But when Stephen King says, &#x201c;The adverb is not your friend,&#x201d; he&#x2019;s not talking about any word that modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb. In the sentence &#x201c;The adverb is not your friend,&#x201d; the word not is an adverb. But not is not King&#x2019;s issue. Nobody reads &#x201c;For sale: baby shoes, never worn&#x201d; and thinks never is an adverb that should have been nixed.<br> <br>When King rails against adverbs in his book On Writing, he describes them as &#x201c;the ones that usually end in -ly.&#x201d; From a statistical standpoint his &#x201c;usually&#x201d; isn&#x2019;t quite true (depending on the author, around 10 to 30 % of all adverbs are ones that end in -ly) but it is true that the adverbs ending in -ly are the ones that tend to stick out.<br> <br>Chuck Palahniuk, best known as the author of Fight Club, has written against -ly adverbs as well. When discussing the importance of minimalism in his book Stranger than Fiction, Palahniuk writes, &#x201c;No silly adverbs like &#x2018;sleepily,&#x2019; &#x2018;irritably,&#x2019; &#x2018;sadly,&#x2019; please.&#x201d; His general argument is that writing should allow us to know when a character is sleepy, or irritable or sad, by using a broader set of clues rather than a single word. Using -ly adverbs goes too far, telling the reader what they should think instead of setting up the scene so that the meaning becomes clear in context.<br> <br>By narrowing our search to just -ly adverbs, we can cut to the heart of the debate. And when we do, the picture flips. For every 10,000 words E L James writes, 155 are -ly adverbs. For Meyer the count is 134, while King averages 105. And Hemingway, living up to his reputation, comes in at a scant 80.<br> <br>Below, for the sake of comparison, is a breakdown of adverb use among 15 different authors.<br> <br><br> <br>Looking at this strict definition of the &#x201c;bad&#x201d; kind of adverb, Hemingway indeed comes out as one of the greats. As we continue to explore in this chapter, whenever I use the term adverb, I will be referring to this &#x201c;bad&#x201d; sort&#x2014;the -ly adverb.<br> Was Hemingway Right?<p></p> <br>The list on the previous page includes a variety of writers, from Nobel Prize winners to viral bestsellers. Hemingway may emerge as a titan of unadorned prose, just as the common perception of him would suggest. But any broader pattern is not so clear. E L James lands at the top of the scale, but greats like Melville and Austen also clock in toward the higher end. By adding more data points, would we be able to pinpoint a reliable pattern in adverb usage?<br> <br>I wanted to find out whether an author&#x2019;s adverb rate reflects anything more than just personal style or preference. I was curious: Could Hemingway have been right about the &#x201c;laws of prose&#x201d;? Is there any meaningful relationship between the quality of a book and how often it uses adverbs?<br> <br>To start answering these questions, it&#x2019;s important to note that just as different authors vary in their use of adverbs, so do different books by the same author. The rate of these -ly adverbs is rare&#x2014;under 2 %&#x2014;even for authors who use them more than other scribes. And there is often great variation from book to book within an author&#x2019;s career.<br> <br>For instance, looking at Hemingway&#x2019;s novels, we see a wide range. Several of his books have adverb rates much lower than most authors ever come close to approaching, while other books bounce around the average usage rate of other authors. True at First Light, a novel about Hemingway&#x2019;s experiences in Africa, is his novel with the highest adverb usage&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s one released thirty years after his death.<br> <br><br> <br>True at First Light was received by critics with negative reviews. It was unfinished at the time of Hemingway&#x2019;s death and edited into shape by his son. Some saw its publication as an unnecessary addition to the canon. Is it a coincidence that it is also his work with the most adverbs?<br> <br>It&#x2019;s of course a poor criterion to judge a book on nothing but its adverb rate, but looking at Hemingway&#x2019;s complete works, we see that most of his classics are also the texts in which he uses the fewest adverbs. The Sun Also Rises, A Farewell to Arms, and For Whom the Bell Tolls have some of the lowest rates&#x2014;and are considered to be among Hemingway&#x2019;s best. The Old Man and the Sea, which won the author the Pulitzer Prize and is often named Hemingway&#x2019;s best work, is the exception.<br> <br>The two American authors to win the Nobel Prize in literature within a decade of Hemingway are William Faulkner and John Steinbeck, and we can pick apart their stats as well.<br> <br>For Steinbeck, the rate of adverb usage again matches up well to perceptions of his work. The Grapes of Wrath, perhaps his most popular work, places third on the list. Of Mice and Men and East of Eden also land toward the low end.<br> <br><br> <br>For Faulkner, the pattern is again present. His most celebrated work, The Sound and the Fury, ranks second with a low 42 adverbs per 10,000. As I Lay Dying and Light in August also come in at the top, while Absalom, Absalom! is just under his average as well.<br> <br><br> <br>But this is just three authors. How far does the pattern go? If we expand outward, do the best books by the best authors use fewer adverbs on average?<br> <br>The authors selected for the tables on the previous pages, and the books highlighted, are some of my own favorites, chosen based on my own preferences. To test whether adverb rates have any correlation with writing quality, I would need a larger set of books and writers&#x2014;and I would need them to be considered &#x201c;great&#x201d; by a consensus of readers.<br> <br>To build a new sample, I turned to four different lists of the best twentieth-century literature: the Library Journal list, the Koen Book Distributor&#x2019;s list, the Modern Library List, and the Radcliffe Publishing Course list. All four lists rank at least 100 works of fiction in English literature. These four lists were also used by Stanford librarian Brian Kunde in his attempt to quantify the best book of the twentieth century (by his scoring it&#x2019;s The Great Gatsby). For my purposes, if a book was included on at least two of the four lists I deemed it a consensus &#x201c;great&#x201d; book. I then selected the authors who had at least two of these, so I would be able to compare their &#x201c;great&#x201d; books to the &#x201c;non-great.&#x201d; (Of course, this method leaves out a lot of excellent authors, but I needed something approaching &#x201c;objective&#x201d; and I needed authors with multiple works.)<br> <br>The result is 15 consensus &#x201c;great&#x201d; authors with a total bibliographyI of 167 fiction books, of which 37 books were considered &#x201c;great&#x201d; by virtue of being on multiple top-100 lists.

I combined all 167 books written by the consensus &#x201c;great&#x201d; authors, and I broke them down into groupings of 50 adverbs per 10,000 words. I then looked at how many books in each group were selected as &#x201c;great&#x201d; versus &#x201c;nongreat.&#x201d; The graph on the following page charts the results. Books with 0&#x2013;49 adverbs per 10,000 words were considered great by critics 67% of the time. Those in the 50&#x2013;100 range were selected as great 29% of the time. On the far end, those with 150-plus received the honor just 16% of the time.<br> <br><br> <br>The downward slope of the graph backs up the advice of Hemingway, King, and countless other writers. While far from absolute, there&#x2019;s a clear trend as adverb use increases. The best books&#x2014;the greats of the greats&#x2014;do use a lower rate of -ly adverbs. On the other hand, an overuse of adverbs has resulted in &#x201c;great&#x201d; books at a far scarcer frequency.<br> Author by Author, Adverb by Adverb<p></p> <br>Looking at the best books all in one graph gives us a compelling picture, but it is still just part of the picture. The greats may tend to use fewer adverbs, but it&#x2019;s also clear that a book or author doesn&#x2019;t need to adopt the same low rate to be great.

Set during three pivotal decades of Irish history, the narrative focuses on four men who participate in the short-lived Rising of 1867 and the irrevocable effects on their lives of the battle of Clonbrony Wood. Ned Nolan returns from America to his hometown of Kilpeder to lead the uprising, programmed by the Irish Republican Brotherhoodthe Fenianswhose sacred oath is the motivating obsession of Ned's existence. He enlists the aid of three of Kilpeder's young men: schoolmaster Hugh MacMahon, Robert Delaney, a bright, ambitious shopkeeper's assistant, and Vincent Tully, charming wastrel son of the town's leading merchant. In the aftermath of the aborted rebellion, Ned hardens into a merciless terrorist. Bob becomes a solicitor, an MP in the party of Charles Stewart Parnell and the lover of the wife of the Earl of Ardmor, who "owns" Kilpeder and lives in an estate overlooking the town. Except for Hugh, who is one of the narrators of this moving story, tragedy stalks each of the veterans of Clonbrony Wood. Their intertwined life dramas are played out against the tragedy of Ireland's bloody attempts to shake the yoke of British rule. The novel beautifully integrates the lives of its fictional characters with a striking depiction of the historical circumstances that motivated rebellion against the Crown. Flanagan's portrayal of the texture of Irish society illuminates the roots of perennial conflict. He skillfully describes the rise of Charles Parnell and the success of the Land League campaign, Parnell's disgrace and the destruction of all his accomplishments while the "damned bloody empire . . . settled back to watch the Irish tear ourselves to pieces." As in all tragedy, there is irony: of Irish informers betraying their compatriots; of Parnell's sudden fall just as home rule seems certain; of the way Bob Delaney's life mirrors that of his leader's. Written in musical prose and imbued with an elegiac strain, the novel also eulogizes the innocence, hope and idealism of youth, which, because "we are all the tenants of Time," gives way to the disillusionment and bitter accommodations of one's maturer years. A fine fusion of solid historical and sociological insight with a shrewd, sensitive grasp of character, plus a steady sweep of dramatic momentum incorporating an affecting portrait of a doomed love affair, this is a book one does not want to put down. It is a significant literary achievement, as timely as today's headlines about violence in Ireland. 100,000 first printing; $100,000 ad/promo; BOMC featured alternate. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Flanagan's The Year of the French was a popular, award-winning, and masterful account of the Irish uprising of 1798. This novel deals with the years between the failed Fenian uprising of 1867 and the death of Parnell late in 1891. Parnell and the Land League agitation of the 1880s had a revolutionary effect upon Irish history. Flanagan vividly shows how the personal histories of his many characters both created and were changed by the history of their times. The nature and meaning of history is one of the themes of this book, as is the way history is remembered and recorded. Flanagan has the mind of a philosophical historian, but also the talent of a gifted storyteller. A model of historical fiction.

Heresy! Who does this man think he is, claiming to speak directly to God?! Jesus did it, Muhammad did it, the Jewish prophets did it, but none of their Gods had the sardonic wit or raw verve of Prophet Walsch&#39;s God. Neale Donald Walsch isn&#39;t claiming to be the Messiah of a new religion, just a frustrated man who sat down one day with pen in his hand and some tough questions in his heart. As he wrote his questions to God, he realized that God was answering them... directly... through Walsch&#39;s pen. The result, far from the apocalyptic predictions or cultic eccentricities you might expect, turns out to be matter-fact, in-your-face wisdom on how to get by in life while remaining true to yourself and your spirituality.Suppose you could ask God the most puzzling questions about existence - questions about love and faith, life and death, good and evil. Suppose God provided clear, understandable answers. It happened to Neale Donald Walsch. It can happen to you. You are about to have a conversation... I have heard the crying of your heart. I have seen the searching of your soul. I know how deeply you have desired the Truth. In pain have you called out for it, and in joy. Unendingly have you beseeched Me. Show Myself. Explain Myself. Reveal Myself. I am doing so here, in terms so plain, you cannot misunderstand. In language so simple, you cannot be confused. In vocabulary so common, you cannot get lost in the verbiage. So go ahead now. Ask Me anything. Anything. I will contrive to bring you the answer. The whole universe will I use to do this. So be on the lookout; this book is far from My only tool. You may ask a question, then put this book down. But watch. Listen. The words to the next song you hear. The information in the next article you read. The story line of the next movie you watch. The chance utterance of the next person you meet. Or the whisper of the next river, the next ocean, the next breeze that caresses your ear - all these devices are Mine; all these avenues are open to Me. I will speak to you if you will listen. I will come to you if you will invite Me. I will show you then that I have always been there. All ways.</p><h2>Shakespeare Stories II</h2><p>By skillfully weaving his own prose with Shakespeare&#39;s language, Leon Garfield has refashioned nine of the Elizabethan playwright&#39;s dramas into stories, capturing all the richness of the characters, plot, mood, and setting. This format will delight both those who know the great dramatist&#39;s works and those who are new to them. Plays included are: Much Ado About Nothing, Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, Measure for Measure, As You Like It, Cymbeline, King Richard the Third, The Comedy of Errors, and The Winter&#39;s Tale.</p><p>Leon Garfield, the distinguished author of more than thirty books for children and adults, has won numerous literary awards and honors, including the Carnegie Medal. Before his death in 1996, he lived in London with his wife, author Vivien Alcock, and their daughter. Michael Foreman is one of England&#39;s foremost children&#39;s illustrators.Grade 6 Up?A worthy sequel to Shakespeare Stories (Houghton, 1991). The first volume covered 12 plays, primarily the more familiar. This one has only nine, and several are unusual fare for young readers. They have mature and often jaded perspectives, which, if not incomprehensible to adolescents, we can hope might seem a bit remote. But Antony and Cleopatra is an interesting follow-up to Julius Caesar; Measure for Measure offers complex fare for morality discussions; and the peculiar magical aspects of Winter's Tale offer an interesting contrast to The Tempest. Reading such enriched retellings of plays students might miss in high school will enhance those they do study. For the guaranteed curriculum basics, such as Julius Caesar, here is an alternative to yellow study guides, one in which explication is subliminally available in the graceful prose. The romances are appealing, and Garfield's seamless movement between his own descriptive language and Shakespeare's has never worked better. Foreman's vibrant watercolors, particularly the mesmerizing Cleopatra cover girl and an anguished Julius Caesar at the Capitol, and the many small ink-wash illustrations bring strong visual appeal to a pending classic?one that adults should not assume is just for kids.?Sally Margolis, Deerfield Public Library, <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Zapp Method of Couture Sewing: Tailor Garments Easily, Using Any Pattern</h2><p>Sew Clothes that Fit Perfectly!

They shared their worries about work and family, literary opinions and scuttlebutt, moments of despair and hilarity.

In the program and book, both titled <i>The Private Life of Plants</i>, Attenborough treks through rainforests, mountain ranges, deserts, beaches, and home gardens to show us things we might never have suspected about the vegetation that surrounds us. With their extraordinary sensibility, plants compete endlessly for survival and interact with animals and insects: they can see, count, communicate, adjust position, strike, and capture. Attenborough makes the plant world a vivid place for readers, who in this book can enjoy the tour at their own pace, taking in the lively descriptions and nearly 300 full-color photos showing plants in close detail.</p><br><p>The author reveals to us the aspects of plants' lives that seem hidden from view, such as fighting, avoiding or exploiting predators or neighbors, and struggling to find food, increase their territories, reproduce themselves, and establish their place in the sun. Among the most amazing examples, the acacia can communicate with other acacias and repel enemies that might eat their leaves, the orchid can impersonate female wasps to attract males and ensure the spreading of its pollen, the Venus's flytrap can take other organisms captive and consume them. Covering this remarkable range of information with enthusiasm and clarity, Attenborough helps us to look anew at the vegetation on which all life depends and which has an intriguing life of its own. He has created a book sure to please the plant lover and any other reader interested in exploring the natural world.</p></p><p><b>Sir David Attenborough,</b> a Fellow of the Royal Society, is also a Trustee of the British Museum and an Honorary Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge. He is an internationally esteemed producer, and has written the bestselling books accompanying his television series <i>Trials of Life</i>, <i>The Living Planet</i>, and <i>Life on Earth</i>. For many weeks <i>The Private Life of Plants</i> was a number-one bestseller in the United Kingdom.Intrepid naturalist Attenborough (Trials of Life, Little, Brown, 1991) once again stalks the planet to find the most fascinating and exquisite specimens to illustrate the wonders of the living world. There are plants in this book that this natural history reviewer and botany major never saw before, such as the Sumatran titan arum with its nine-foot-tall inflorescence and the equally elusive British ghost orchid, which regularly reappears after being declared extinct. Attenborough notes that plants "must grapple with much the same problems as animals, including ourselves," and describes these endeavors in chapters on traveling, feeding and growing, flowering, social struggle, living together, and surviving. Other popularizations have covered the same basic territory, but rarely in such a captivating way. Highly recommended for natural history collections at all levels.

Allen Counter arranged to visit the remote villages where Robert Peary, the credited discoverer, and Matthew Henson, the black man whose contributions to the expedition are widely ignored, stayed during their travels. This book recounts the astonishing story of Counter&#x2019;s trips to Greenland and the relationships he develops with the Eskimo ancestors of the two men. At the same time, new evidence about Peary&#x2019;s journey to the Pole is examined, and it comes to light that Henson, was the true hero.<br></p><p><b>S. Allen Counter</b> is a neuroscientist at Harvard and the founder of the Harvard Foundation, an organization devoted to intercultural and race relations. He lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.In 1986 the author, a neuroscience professor at Harvard, went to northern Greenland to conduct a study of ear disease in Eskimos as well as to interview them about early American explorations in that area. And he had yet another goal: black himself, Counter had long admired black explorer Matthew Henson, who accompanied Robert Peary to the Pole. Familiar with rumors that each had fathered children in Greenland, the author traced "dark-skinned" Eskimos to two remote settlements, where he found Anaukaq Henson and Kali Peary, octogenarians who had never met their American relatives. Counter, who subsequently arranged a three-month trip to the U.S. for both men, here offers a charming account of their meetings with kinfolk in Massachusetts, New York and Maine, visits to their fathers' gravesites--Henson's in Brooklyn, N.Y., Peary's in Arlington, Va.--and tours of national monuments. The book, an intriguing postscript to polar exploration, also examines the Peary-Henson collaboration and supports the claim that they indeed reached the Pole.

Dating back to the Great Awakening of colonial times, the music of the English hymn writers Isaac Watts and John Wesley was used to stir the spirit and bring heaven to earth. When the newly converted slaves worshipped at these revivals, and at the camp meetings that followed later in the wake of the Second Awakening, they made these hymns their own. They accented and elongated unexpected syllables for rhythmic effect, patting their feet and clapping their hands in tempos remembered from a faraway but still vivid homeland. Under the great tents of the camp meetings, visitors listened to the rich voices of spontaneous black choirs, raising the hymns, calling and responding to each other beneath the vast canvas. As the poetic but deeply felt lyrics and simple melodies of these English hymns met the rhythm and improvisational techniques of Mother Africa, the spiritual was born.<br><br>The Azusa Street Revival also produced a new and dynamic black worship music. This time it emerged from the individual in the throes of Pentecostal rapture--singing in the Spirit and testifying to the goodness of God. Born in the city, this new music built on the foundation of the hymns and spirituals but charged them with a power and conviction that had never been heard before. This time the music was more personal, emotional and rhythmically irresistible. It drew the young and those who resisted the traditional church experience to the Spirit's new urban outpost--the storefront church--where the young Church of God in Christ denomination and its unique music spread like wildfire. You could hear the sound for blocks--tambourines beating at fever pitch, a cappella harmonies and joyful hallelujahs.<br><br>As slaves once used the unique rhythm and improvisational technique of Mother Africa's music to transform English hymns into spirituals, the Church of God in Christ now ignited these hymns and spirituals with Pentecostal fire to create a dynamic, new music for the black church--gospel.<br><br>At the Overcoming Church of God in Christ on Mercer Street, just around the corner from Court Street, the Drinkard children first heard the new music.<br><br>My sister Reebie learned to play the tambourine there. She says, "We learned to get a lot of rhythm; to clap our hands in time. We learned syncopation there. We didn't have any music there, just tambourines, foot-patting; we sang a cappella."<br><br>My sister Anne's description of the Spirit-led music at the Overcoming Church of God in Christ makes it sound like the "spontaneous choirs" of the camp meetings in the 1800s:<br><br>"Someone would start a song over here and the rest of us would pick it up all over the church--in harmony," says Anne. "You could just feel true harmonies going through the whole church!"<br><br>We were just children. And only now, as I look back, do I really appreciate Mother Gillespie and Elder Wyatt. They were not just Christians who were totally sold out to God--that would have been enough!&nbsp;&nbsp;But they were also incredibly talented teachers. I am convinced that Mother Gillespie had designed every detail of her person and demeanor to focus our complete attention on her: from the simplicity of her dress to her graceful manner and the attentive gaze she fixed upon you--as if at that moment there was nobody else in the world that mattered more than you. Because she was so single-minded, so pure in her mission of teaching us spiritual truth through music, she created in us something that I don't even think she knew she was doing. Maybe she did. Her teachings sparked in us the desire to try to sing together on our own.<br><br>I don't remember when my brothers and sisters first tried it. We were probably all fooling around, playing church one day. Nicky imitating Elder Wyatt, shouting, "Give me a song, give me a song." Anne, Larry and me, his mock congregation, started to raise a hymn, like in church. And something must've just clicked when we heard what was coming out of our mouths.<br><br>"It was a miracle . . . or a mystery," says Anne. "We were in perfect harmony. It just fell right in. If Cissy was singing lead, I'd fall back into her harmony part and the rest of them would fall in around me. The same thing would happen if I took the lead; Cissy, Larry and Nicky would fall in around me. It was just something that happened automatically in our heads, our minds, or . . . our souls."<br><br>Once my father got a load of us, that was the end of my carefree childhood!&nbsp;&nbsp;He had Reebie teaching us songs, rehearsing us every night of the week. We sang at St. Luke's AME. When relatives came over, all they ever wanted to do was hear us sing. I'd run in my room and hide--boy, that would make my father mad! You have to remember, I was only five years old!&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to keep playing like a normal kid--hopscotch, skully, jump rope. Eventually, when threatened with corporal punishment, I relented and joined my brothers and sisters. "All right now, children," he would say. "Strike me up a tune." My aunts and uncles always wanted to hear me sing "I'm Waiting and Watching." I got sick of that one in no time. I was just being a normal kid; contrary, wanting to do something other than what my parents wanted me to do.<br><br>Looking back, the discipline of rehearsing, learning new songs was good for me even if I was on the young side. I might have pouted and stuck my lip out a mile long, but I couldn't deny my daddy anything. Not when I saw how happy our singing made him. He'd listen to us and get this big smile on his face and nod his head in time to the song. "Sing, children," he would say, smiling. "Sing, baby," he would say softly, if I took the lead.<br><br>My father's burdens--surviving, feeding us all during the Depression, the recent blaze on Court Street and my mother's stroke--for a moment must have eased as he leaned back in his chair and listened to us sing.<br><br>He still had his problems. God didn't wave some magic wand over his life. The fires in the Furnace of Affliction would still burn; he would still have to go through the fire. He knew that. But as he listened to his children sing to him now, he could imagine himself, like Daniel's friends, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, walking about in the very midst of the fire, yet unharmed, for the Son of God was walking with him, by his side all the while.<br><br>He closed his eyes, and thought back to Hilton, Georgia, when he was a boy, singing with his father and his uncles in the fields and in the house at night. No audience, just singing for themselves, in the glow of a kerosene lamp. <br><br><i>You know, my God did <br>Just what He said, uh-huh <br>Oh yes, He did, uh-huh <br>Oh yes, He did. <br>You know, He healed the sick <br>And He raised the dead, uh-huh <br>Oh yes, He did, uh-huh <br>Oh yes, He did . . . </i><br><br>It felt so good, singing in my soul; Nitch, his uncles, their faces raised, their breath as one, blowing the tight quartet harmony into the air. They sounded so good. Drinkards!&nbsp;&nbsp;The best farmers in Early County . . . the best quartet singers in Georgia. The best. Just like his children now. Singing in my soul. Thank You, Father; You have given them this song, You have given them the harmony of brothers and sisters in their throats and in their hearts. Keep them together, I pray . . . protect them . . . use them; may many come to know You through their voices.<br><br>Inside my father's heart a vision was being born.

After graduation, he went to Vienna to study Freudian psychoanalysis for a year and following his first book, an edition of Florio's translation of 'Montaigne', was offered a lectureship at the University of Leeds. In 1932 he married Margaret Hardwick, a doctor, and they subsequently had five children including Angus, also a novelist. The year 1936 saw Innes as Professor of English at the University of Adelaide, during which tenure he wrote his first mystery story, 'Death at the President's Lodging'. With his second, 'Hamlet Revenge', Innes firmly established his reputation as a highly entertaining and cultivated writer. After the end of World War II, he returned to the UK and spent two years at Queen's University, Belfast, where in 1949 he wrote the 'Journeying Boy', a novel notable for the richly comedic use of an Irish setting. He then settled down as a Reader in English Literature at Christ Church, Oxford, from which he retired in 1973. Innes's most famous character is 'John Appleby', who inspired a penchant for donnish detective fiction that lasts to this day. His other well-known character is 'Honeybath', the painter and rather reluctant detective, who first appeared in 1975 in 'The Mysterious Commission'. The last of the Innes novels, 'Appleby and the Ospreys', was published in 1986, some eight years before his death in 1994. His work is still very highly regarded and 'Appleby's End' and 'The New Sonia Wayward' were chosen by H.R.F. Keating as being amongst the best 100 crime novels ever written. The 'Times Literary Supplement' said of him: 'A Master - he constructs a plot that twists and turns like an electric eel: it gives you shock upon shock and you cannot let go.</p>Published in 1978 and 1946, respectively, these offer a double dose of British mystery by the popular Innes. Each title contains thievery, betrayal, intrigue, and a touch of murder for good measure. Both will be popular in large mystery collections.<br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>First Generations: Women in Colonial America</h2><p><br>Indian, European, and African women of seventeenth and eighteenth-century America were defenders of their native land, pioneers on the frontier, willing immigrants, and courageous slaves. They were also - as traditional scholarship tends to omit - as important as men in shaping American culture and history. This remarkable work is a gripping portrait that gives early-American women their proper place in history.<br><br></p><p>This study of American women in the 17th and 18th centuries by historian Carol Berkin gives close attention to the lives of several women like Mary, who was brought to Virginia as a slave in 1622. She married another African, Antonio, and over the course of their 40-year marriage, they earned their freedom and established a 250-acre plantation before moving to Maryland in search of new land. Other black women were not so lucky and, as time progressed, laws restricting black freedom were codified. This study uses legal and other types of records to illuminate the lives and experiences of these and other black, white, and Native American women.Carol Berkin is professor of history at Baruch College and the CUNY Graduate Center.</p><h2>The Bible: Its story for children</h2><p>An illustrated version with simplified text of the Old and New Testaments.</p><p></p><h2>In Wonderland: The Surrealist Adventures of Women Artists in Mexico and the United States</h2><p>Filled with a wide array of illustrations, this book offers a fresh perspective on surrealism as it spotlights the important role that North American women artists played in the movement. The surrealist movement in art is most often identified with male artists, many of whom objectified women in their paintings, casting them as sexual or symbolic ideals.

L. A.] Marshall asserted that only 15 to 25 percent of American soldiers ever fired their weapons in combat in World War II. . . .<br>Shooting at the enemy made a man part of the &#x201c;team,&#x201d; or &#x201c;brotherhood.&#x201d; There were, of course, many times when soldiers did not want to shoot, such <br>as at night when they did not want to give away a position or on reconnaissance patrols. But, in the main, no combat soldier in his right mind would have deliberately sought to go through the entire ear without ever firing his weapon, because he would have been excluded from the brotherhood but also because it would have been detrimental to his own survival.

Alpert served for thirteen years with the U.S. Department of Justice as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, where he was chief of environmental litigation. There, Alpert investigated, prosecuted, or supervised many complex civil and criminal cases, some resulting in multimillion-dollar awards.<i>The Birthday Party</i> [is] one of the most exhilarating, improbable New York stories ever told. -- <i><i>New York Times</i>, January 24, 2007</i><br><br>Alpert wins over the reader the same way he did the kidnappers, with the force of his canny, self-assured, bighearted personality. -- <i><i>New York Times Book Review</i>, April 22, 2007</i><br><br>Favorite Books of 2007 Nonfiction: <p>Alpert was kidnapped in 1998 in Manhattan after his 38th birthday party; his memoir of the experience is "like watching a slow-motion train wreck -- difficult to look at but impossible to turn away from." -- <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review, December 9, 2007</i><br><br>On Jan. 21, 1998, Assistant U.S. Attorney Stanley Alpert is about to celebrate his 38th birthday. Coming home to his Greenwich Village apartment after a disappointing blind date, he becomes the target of a hapless gang of stupidly vicious punks who kidnap him, hoping to use his ATM card to gain access to his bank account. </p><p>"The Birthday Party: A Memoir of Survival" is not a funny book, although some of what happens in the course of the harrowing next 26 hours is funny. It may be hard to remember that in 1998 cell phones were far from ubiquitous and the horrors of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks hadn't happened. </p><p>Despite the passage of time, however, I have no doubt that Alpert's recollection of those events and conversations, including the lame jokes, are entirely accurate. Life-changing experiences are often seared into memory, complete with details of sound, smell and taste that defy ordinary recall. And even though he eventually escapes from his captors and sees his assailants brought to justice, it is clear that Alpert continues to grapple with the disturbing effects of that violation. </p><p>Contrast is everything: We see Alpert's $70 Florsheims as opposed to the thugs' $130 Air Jordans. The punks drive a black Lexus. The lawyer doesn't own a car. Alpert and his captors are products of New York's mean streets. Alpert grew up as a nice Jewish kid in Brooklyn just as the safe, working-class neighborhood was changing to a gang- and drug-infested one. His parents divorced. His family was poor, and he grew up dealing with routine muggings. Ultimately, this impoverished childhood served as the catalyst to a desire to succeed and sent him in search of an education. His attackers see their backgrounds, ironically not all that different from Alpert's, as excuses for turning to lives of crime and drugs and as a justification for their stealing what Alpert has legitimately earned. "Hey, you have an education. You can always earn it back," one said. </p><p>In the face of his captors' terrifying threats, Alpert forces himself to remain calm. When the thugs threaten to harm his elderly father, the blindfolded hostage engages in a life-and-death game of mental chess to protect his family without inflaming his captors. Throughout the ordeal, he is faced with the very real understanding that his assailants have nothing to lose and that these may be his last few precious hours on this earth. </p><p>Anyone who has ever watched "Cops" knows that most crooks aren't geniuses. These bad guys here are no exception. Their schemes are violent, overblown and essentially stupid, but what's truly chilling is how young these perpetrators are, how devoid of any moral compass and how ignorant they are of how the world works. Their behavior is ultimately so bizarre (including offering their captive sex with one of their group's female members) and so puzzling (they let him go for no clear reason) that investigators don't believe Alpert's story. </p><p>At first they think that he made up the whole thing. But the clues Alpert manages to provide - part of a cell phone number, the pattern of tiles in a brownstone lobby and the name of a local deli - eventually provide enough information so that the kidnappers are found and brought to justice. Their videotaped interrogations and unwittingly damning confessions, rendered verbatim, are simultaneously incredibly arrogant and incredibly sad. These are young people who know not they know not. </p><p>Reading "The Birthday Party" is like watching a slow-motion train wreck - difficult to look at but impossible to turn away from. Alpert depicts good guys and bad guys in vivid detail, bringing into focus the motivations and backgrounds of both the perpetrators and the cops, FBI agents and district attorneys. </p><p>Those telling details - alternately funny, appalling, fascinating and scary - are the product of some hard-won wisdom on Alpert's part. That's the real gift he received on the occasion of his remarkably memorable 38th birthday. "The Birthday Party" is a good read, but it is also an object lesson. We all need to pay attention to it. -- <i>Newsday, February 4, 2007</i><br><br>Stark and honest. -- <i><i>Kirkus Reviews</i>, starred review, November 1, 2006</i><br><br>THE BIRTHDAY PARTY: A Memoir of Survival. By Stanley N. Alpert. (Putnam, $24.95.) In the 1970s, muggings in the Brooklyn neighborhood where Alpert, a federal prosecutor, grew up were so frequent that they followed a shorthand script ("Yo, lend me a dime"). The racial tensions of that era form the backdrop for Alpert's account of his ordeal as the victim of a kidnapping that took place in 1998, on the night before his 38th birthday. Grabbed at gunpoint in Greenwich Village by three toughs who demanded his A.T.M. password and took $800 from his account, Alpert was then held overnight at the apartment of an associate of the kidnappers in preparation for a half-baked scheme to compel him to withdraw $50,000 from his bank the next day. The night was by turns harrowing and farcical; his captors' friends came by to eat McDonald's takeout, smoke pot and have sex in the presence of the blindfolded, terror-stricken prisoner. Alpert remained acutely alert during his captivity, psychologically manipulating his kidnappers and noting every feature of his surroundings to help investigators should he survive. The rest of his tale, a more conventional police procedural, is something of an anticlimax, though well served by his litigator's sense for dramatic pacing and the telling detail. And throughout, Alpert wins over the reader the same way he did the kidnappers, with the force of his canny, self-assured, bighearted personality. -- <i>New York Times Sunday Book Review, April 22, 2006</i></p></p><h2>The Kristy&#39;s Great Idea (The Baby-Sitters Club #1) (1)</h2><p>It all began with a great idea ... and the inspiring original story of the Baby-sitters Club is back!

Martin</strong> <p> Q: It's been a decade since the last Baby-sitters Club books came out, and 24 years since the first book was published. What was it like to come back to the BSC after so many years away?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong> I had a great time re-visiting the characters. It was fun to explore their lives in the prequel, &#x201c;"The Summer Before," and to figure out what led the girls to form The Baby-sitters Club, something that would eventually change their lives. It was like a reunion with friends--friends who haven&#x2019;t changed a bit. <br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> Kristy, Claudia, Mary Anne, and Stacey are very different characters, which is in part why the series was and is still so popular. Every reader can relate to at least one of the characters. So, we have to ask you--which character are you most like?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong> I am most like Mary Anne who is the shy and quiet one. Like me, Mary Anne enjoys more solitary pursuits such as reading and needlework. My favorite character, however, is Kristy. I think she's my alter ego.<br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> Were you allowed to baby-sit when you were twelve? If so, were they any funny or awful stories you'd like to share? <br><br> <strong>Martin: </strong> Yes, I did a lot of baby-sitting when I was twelve. One of the worst and also funniest things that ever happened was when I was baby-sitting for our neighbors and the kids wanted to wash their parents' car. They started the job with much enthusiasm--using Brillo pads. <br><br><strong>Q:</strong> More than 200 BSC books were published in the eighties and nineties. Are there any that you are particularly fond of and why?<br><br> <strong>Martin: </strong> My favorite Baby-sitters Club book is "Kristy's Great Idea," which is the first book and sets the series in motion. I also like the more serious books such as "Claudia and the Sad Good-bye," which deals with the death of Claudia&#x2019;s grandmother. This book was written shortly after my own grandmother died. My other favorite BSC books include &#x201c;Kristy and the Secret of Susan,&#x201d; in which the members of the BSC baby-sit for a child with autism, and "Jessi's Secret Language" in which the girls learn American Sign Language in order to communicate with a sitting charge with profound hearing impairment.<br><br> <strong>Q: </strong>Why do you think that the series is so well-loved and has endured over so many years? <br><br><strong>Martin:</strong> I think the characters in the BSC books are easily relatable. The books deal with timeless topics including friendship, family, and school. Also, the books tackle serious issues including racism, bullying, kids with disabilities (physical and mental), and death of a loved one. These issues were relevant to kids in the 1980s and 1990s, and are still relevant to kids today. In addition to being relatable, these are characters readers can aspire to. The kids run a business--in this case, a baby-sitting business. They are entrepreneurial, independent, creative, and confident. And at the heart of the series is the friendship--the "glue" that binds these characters. Sure, they have fights, but they're loyal and they support one another. I think a lot of us--even adults--can relate to that. <br><br> <strong>Q: </strong>"The Summer Before" takes place during the summer before the girls enter the seventh grade--where suddenly there's a ton of pressure to fit in. The months leading up to it can be filled with anxiety, excitement, and anticipation. Do you remember how you spent the summer before seventh grade? <br><br><strong>Martin:</strong> I was nervous that summer because in the fall I would be going to a new school &#x2013; the junior high (this was in the time before middle schools). Even the words "junior high" seemed terribly grown-up. My friends and I would be attending school with eighth-graders, who were one step away from high school. I spent that summer reading, going to the community pool, taking a family trip to Cape May, New Jersey, doing some baby-sitting, and also recovering from surgery. But the knowledge that I would soon be in junior high school colored every day and every activity and did lend the summer an air of both anxiety and anticipation.<br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> Despite the fun the girls have together in "The Summer Before," they're all dealing with pretty tough problems&#x2014;moving away, an absentee father, a first crush. How did you choose the issues you wanted to focus on?<br><br> <strong>Martin:&nbsp;</strong> One of my favorite things about writing a series was that the characters themselves generated plot ideas for later books. One of the themes that developed as the series progressed was that of Kristy's relationship with her father. It was an idea I enjoyed exploring, and when I had the opportunity to write the prequel I realized that this summer would be a charged time for Kristy, and that I could introduce the issues she had with her father here; then they could unfold in the later books. The same applied to Stacey. Her reasons for moving to Stoneybrook had been revealed in later books, but I realized that during this particular summer the reader could actually watch the events take place. The other issues &#x2013; a first crush, wanting more independence yet still feeling like a kid--are themes that I felt would resonate with most "tween" readers.<br><strong><br> Q: </strong>Even though the books have been out of print for ten years there are still some very devoted fans. Surely you must have received a ton of letters about the series over the years. Are there any that stick out in your mind?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong> The most memorable are stories of girls who have written to me and told me that I&#x2019;ve made an impact on their lives, that The Baby-sitters Club books have turned them into readers. Some have also said that the BSC books made them aspire to become writers. I&#x2019;ve also heard from a lot of the original fans who grew up to become teachers, librarians, editors, journalists, entrepreneurs, etc. To know that this series inspired a generation of readers and writers is very humbling. <br><br> <strong>Q:</strong> There&#x2019;s been a lot of speculation in the blogosphere about where Claudia, Kristy, Mary Ann, and Stacey would be now, in 2010, had they grown up. Do you have any thoughts on what path each would have taken?<br><br> <strong>Martin:</strong>&nbsp; I understand the fascination of the older BSC fans who would like to know what happened with the characters when they got older. It&#x2019;s thrilling to realize that after all these years the fans remain passionate about the books and the characters in The Baby-sitters Club. I can see Kristy running a business--I can also see her being in politics. I think Mary Anne became a teacher. I imagine Stacey went into fashion--not as a designer, but maybe on the business side. And Claudia became an artist. I think fans can fill in for the rest of the characters!<br><br> </p>Ann M.

His ability to represent a subject with an absolute fidelity to every detail seemed miraculous to his contemporaries, and still astounds us now: we need only think of his water-colours of plants and animals.<br> <br> In addition, D�rer was the first painter to devote such close attention to the art of the self-portrait. No artist before him painted as many as he. The works by D�rer collected in this book show the full range of this artist&#x2019;s unique genius. &nbsp; <strong>About the Series:</strong><br> Each book in TASCHEN&#x2019;s Basic Art series features:<ul> <li>a detailed chronological summary of the life and oeuvre of the artist, covering his or her cultural and historical importance</li> <li>a concise biography</li> <li>approximately 100 illustrations with explanatory captions</li> </ul></p><p></p><h2>Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing</h2><p>Peter finds his demanding two-and-a-half-year-old brother an ever increasing problem.</p><p>Passed on from babysitters to their young charges, from big sisters to little brothers, and from parents to children, <i>Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing</i> and its cousins (<i>Superfudge</i>, <i>Fudge-a-mania</i>, and <i>Otherwise Known as Sheila the Great</i>) have entertained children since they first appeared in the early 1970s. The books follow Peter Hatcher, his little brother Fudgie, baby sister Tootsie, their neighbor Sheila Tubman, various pets, and minor characters through New York City and on treks to suburbs and camps. <p> <i>Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing</i> is the first of these entertaining yarns. Peter, because he's the oldest, must deal with Fudgie's disgusting cuteness, his constant meddling with Peter's stuff, and other grave offenses, one of which is almost too much to bear. All these incidents are presented with the unfailing ear and big-hearted humor of the masterful Judy Blume. Though some of her books for older kids have aroused controversy, the Hatcher brothers and their adventures remain above the fray, where they belong. (Peter's in fourth grade, so the book is suitable for kids ages 8 and older.)</p>Fourth grader Peter Hatcher, a neighbor of Sheila Tubman of <i>Otherwise Known As Sheila The Great</i>, has a terrible problem -- his little brother!

He was nominated for the Bram Stoker award for his novel Blackburn, and won the World Fantasy Award for Best Collection in 1995. His novel, Buddy Holly Is Alive and Well on Ganymede won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.From the most disparate elements imaginable, Denton fashions an illogical, uproarious, yet ultimately memorable hardcover debut whose narrator, video salesman Oliver Vale, finds all the channels on his TV preempted by a live broadcast of long-dead legendary rocker Buddy Holly. Between songs, Holly advises his audience to call Oliver Vale for assistance! Unfortunately, Oliver has no idea why--though his late mother's personal religion involved rock music, UFOlogy and other New Age practices. However, the Holly broadcast occupies all channels on all TVs worldwide, and originates on Ganymede, so Oliver suddenly finds himself in great demand. Hoping to make sense of it all, he decides to head for Holly's gravesite in Lubbock, Texas, aboard his old motorbike Peggy Sue--only to be accosted by his neighbors Cathy and Jeremy (they turn out to be aliens) and their huge, smart dog Ringo (a cyborg). Pursued by a sinister government operative, the Bald Avenger, Oliver flees toward a showdown with rabble-rousing televangelist William Willard and yet more alien complications. Riotous doings, with oddball characters too numerous to mention, anchored in a sensitive and absorbing exploration of Oliver's relationship with his mother. The plot doesn't add up, or even make much sense: the parts of this gloriously mad, serious- hearted outing from an exceptionally promising new talent, are greater than the whole. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Responding to basic questions on the themes of why and for whom they write, and how they perceive their responsibility to their work, to others, and to society, these well-known playwrights, poets, novelists, and essayists talk about the connections between their lives and their art. Toni Morrison notes that the longing for commercial success "is a substitute for value in your life." Kristin Hunter is "interested in the enormous and varied adaptations of black people to the distorting, terrifying restrictions of society." Toni Cade Bambara wants readers to understand why women need to keep writing their "anger, dismay, disappointment, or just sheer bewilderment" about the woman-man thing: "Women are not going to shut up. We care too much... about the development of ourselves and our brothers, fathers, lovers, sons to negotiate a bogus peace." Nikki Giovanni speaks of alienation as a force which can produce vigor: "Our strength is that we are not comfortable any place; therefore, we're comfortable every place." In this superb collection, the answers, asides, and truth-telling are as diverse, dazzling, and large-spirited as the writers themselves. <i>-- For great reviews of books for girls, check out Let's Hear It for the Girls: 375 Great Books for Readers 2-14</i>. -- <i>From 500 Great Books by Women; review by Jesse Larsen</i></p><h2>Frederick&#39;s Fables: A Leo Lionni Treasury of Favorite Stories</h2><p>Illustrated on every page, this sumptuous anthology contains thirteen of Lionni&#39;s most popular animal fables, including three Caldecott Honor books--Alexander and the Wind-Up Mouse, Swimmy, and Frederick. Reissue.</p><p>Leo Lionni wrote and illustrated more than 40 picture books, including four Caldecott Honor Books. He died in 1999 at the age of 89.In an introduction by the eminent psychologist Bruno Bettelheim, parents are assured that picture books help little children to make sense of reality. He praises Lionni's "images which in one visual experience convey more than can be said in 1000 words." This is a collection of the artist's famous works, first published as individual titles. Each economic, easily grasped tale is richly illustrated by the artist's color paintings and collages, emphasizing the meaning in the actions of the mouse Frederick and other lovable creatures. There are 13 stories, with variations on Lionni's central theme: the importance of gaining wisdom and of being, always, one's self without forgetting that everyone is part of society and responsible (like clever Swimmy, star of his own film) to all others. <br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Somebody Else&#39;s Music: A Gregor Demarkian Novel (Gregor Demarkian Novels)</h2><p><i>Every school class has a target.

Now he was the fastest boy in Manhattan, New York. He was so fast, in fact, the ship that had brought him to America arrived a day early.</p><p>Now he stood on first base, waiting to run.</p><p>&#x201c;Put the poreen just about here, ya rawney Dutchman!&#x201d; the Striker called. English was difficult enough for Felix to understand, and almost unintelligible when spoken by the Irish. But the &#x201c;Dutchman&#x201d; at Feeder&#x2014;another German boy like Felix&#x2014;didn&#x2019;t need to understand Cormac&#x2019;s words to know where he wanted him to throw the ball. He lobbed it toward the plate and the Irish boy slapped the ball to the right side beyond first base.</p><p>Felix ran full out. His legs churned in the soft mud, but his shoes gave him traction, propelling him toward second base. He was a racehorse, a locomotive. The world was a blur when he ran, and he could feel his blood thumping through his veins like the steam pistons pounding out a rhythm on the fast ferry to Staten Island. Felix flew past the parcel that stood for second base and dug for third.</p><p>&#x201c;Soak him!&#x201d; one of the boys called. Felix glanced over his shoulder just in time to see an English boy hurl the baseball at him. He danced out of the way and the ball sailed past him, missing his vest by less than an inch. Felix laughed and charged on to third, turning on the cap there and heading for home.</p><p>&#x201c;Soak the bloody devil!&#x201d; one of the other Irish boys cried. The ball came at Felix again, but this time the throw was well wide. He pounced on the rock at home plate with both feet and celebrated the point.</p><p>&#x201c;Ace!&#x201d; Felix cried. &#x201c;Ace, ace, ace!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No it weren&#x2019;t,&#x201d; called one of the buckwheats, a boy just back from the Ohio territory. &#x201c;You missed second base!&#x201d;</p><p>Felix ran straight to second base to argue, and was met there by the boys on both teams.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re out, ya plonker!&#x201d; said one of the Irish boys.</p><p>&#x201c;The heck I was!&#x201d; said Felix. He stepped forward to challenge him, and the boy laughed.</p><p>&#x201c;You sure you want to get them fancy ones and twos there muddy, Dutchman?&#x201d;</p><p>He was on again about Felix&#x2019;s shoes, which were better than everyone else&#x2019;s. Felix&#x2019;s father, a cobbler, had made them for him&#x2014;sturdy brown leather lace-ups with good thick heels. They were the only thing he still had to remind him of his family back in Bremen.</p><p>The boys looked down at Felix&#x2019;s shoes. That&#x2019;s when they all saw Felix&#x2019;s footprints in the wet earth. He&#x2019;d missed second base by a foot.</p><p>&#x201c;Three out, all out,&#x201d; the buckwheat said.</p><p>Felix snatched the ball from the boy&#x2019;s hand and plunked him hard in the shoulder with it.</p><p>&#x201c;Run!&#x201d; Felix cried.</p><p>The lot became a battlefield as both teams went back and forth, tagging each other and dashing for home to see who would earn the right to bat next. Felix had just ducked out of the way of a ball aimed for his head when someone grabbed him by the ear and stood him up.</p><p>&#x201c;Felix Schneider!&#x201d; his uncle Albert yelled.</p><p>The game of tag ground to an abrupt halt and the boys shirked away as Felix&#x2019;s uncle laid into him.</p><p>&#x201c;I knew you would be here, you worthless boy! You should have been back an hour ago! Where is the parcel you were sent to deliver?&#x201d;</p><p>Felix glanced meekly at second base.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve buried it in the mud!?&#x201d; Felix&#x2019;s uncle cuffed him. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve ruined those pieces, it&#x2019;ll mean both our jobs! My family will be out on the streets, and you will never earn passage for yours. Is this why you stowed away aboard that ship? To come to America and play games?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;N-no sir.&#x201d;</p><p>Uncle Albert dragged Felix over to the parcel.</p><p>&#x201c;Pick it up. Pick it up!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t step on it, see? I missed the bag&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>His uncle struck him again, and Felix said nothing more. With his speed he knew he still had plenty of time to deliver the fabric pieces, and time enough to go to the Neumans&#x2019;, pick up their finished suits, and get them to Lord &amp; Taylor by the close of business too. He also knew his uncle wouldn&#x2019;t want to hear it.</p><p>&#x201c;Now go. Go!&#x201d; Uncle Albert told him. &#x201c;If you were my son, I&#x2019;d whip you!&#x201d;</p><p><i>And if I were your son,</i> thought Felix as he dashed off with the parcel, <i>I&#x2019; d run away to California.</i></p><p>Felix ran to where the Neumans lived on East Eighth Street off Avenue B, in the heart of &#x201c;Kleindeutschland,&#x201d; Little Germany. Their tenement stood in the shadow of a fancier building facing the street on the same lot. The Neumans lived on the fourth floor, two brothers and their families squeezed into a one-family flat with three rooms and no windows. Felix hated visiting there. It made him think of those preachers who stood on street corners throughout Kleindeutschland yelling warnings of damnation and hell. As much as he disliked his uncle, Felix knew that but for Uncle Albert&#x2019;s job as a cutter, their own Kleindeutschland flat would look like this. Or worse.</p><p>One of the Neuman boys, not much older than Felix, met him at the door. Felix only knew him from deliveries and pickups&#x2014;he&#x2019;d never seen any of the Neuman boys playing on Little Germany&#x2019;s streets or empty lots.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Guten tag,&#x201d;</i> the boy said.</p><p>&#x201c;Good morning,&#x201d; said Felix. He held out the parcel. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got your new pieces.&#x201d;</p><p>The boy let Felix into the room. It was hot and dark, and Neumans young and old sweated as they sewed cut pieces of cloth into suits around the dim light of four flickering candles. Herr Neuman, the family &#x201c;foreman,&#x201d; came forward to take the package from Felix.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Danke sch�n,&#x201d;</i> Herr Neuman said.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome,&#x201d; Felix said. <i>&#x201c;Bitte.&#x201d;</i></p><p>Herr Neuman set the parcel on a table and opened it, counting out the pieces. He nodded to let Felix know everything was in order.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have anything for me to take back?&#x201d; Felix asked. <i>&#x201c;Haben Sie noch etwas fertig?&#x201d;</i></p><p>Herr Neuman held up a finger and went into another room.

But Sheriff Brady is the law in Cochise County, and she will never allow her private trials to interfere with the job she was elected to perform -- especially now that murder has shattered the small town&#39;s fragile peace. A local gun dealer has died violently, and his stock of high-powered weapons has been cleaned out. When two more slayings follow soon after, suspicion falls upon rancher Alton Hosfield, an embittered ,man at war with the federal government, environmentalists, area newcomers, the local law--with anyone, in fact, whom she perceives as a threat to his home, his family, his freedom, and his isolation. Sheriff Brady suspects, however, that the solution is not cut-and-dried. An incendiary situation is getting hotter by the minute, and the last thing Joanna wants is another &#34;Ruby Ridge&#34; in her jurisdiction. But her preoccupation with bringing a cold-blooded killer to justice could take a terrible toll on her personal life. . .and unravel threads of family, love, and responsibility that might never again be retied.</p><p><i>Rattlesnake Crossing</i> is J.A. Jance's sixth novel in the acclaimed Joanna Brady series (readers may also be familiar with her Seattle-based J.P. Beaumont series). Brady is no tough-talking V.I. Warshawski or Kat Colorado; her appeal lies in her willingness to admit that her Cochise County sheriff's uniform is often an uneasy fit. As the single mother of a young daughter, Brady is prey to the pain and loneliness that have resulted from her husband's brutal murder, and she struggles to prove to herself and others that she is capable of bringing a cold-blooded killer to justice.<p> When Clyde Philips, a local gun dealer, dies violently, his stock of high-powered assault weapons vanishes, and two sniper slayings follow soon after, suspicion falls upon Alton Hosfield, an embittered rancher at odds with the federal government, the environmentalists, and anyone else he sees as a threat to his isolation. Sheriff Brady, however, suspects that the solution may lie elsewhere, and her investigation takes her into the bizarre practices of a local resort whose appeal is equal parts New Age spiritualism, Native American pantheism, and cold-blooded materialism.</p><p> Jance has a talent for weaving prosaic threads into a gripping mystery narrative. As a result, Brady must--in addition to tracking a vicious killer--cope with the impossibly high standards of her insufferable mother; the spiteful comments of Marliss Shackleford, an old high school rival and current gossip columnist for the <i>Bisbee Bee</i>; and some rather unexpected news from Butch Dixon, her would-be ardent suitor. As with earlier Brady mysteries, the domestic context provides a deliciously ironic backdrop for the game of psychological cat-and-mouse being played in the Arizona desert. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>The Bookcassette� format is a special recording technique developed as a means of condensing the full, unabridged audio text of a book to record it on fewer tapes.

This self-styled fly in the buttermilk worked among whites with such skill and grace that they were barely aware of his existence - unless he wanted to get a bank loan or move into their neighborhood. Now, in his lively and optimistic autobiography, he speaks of his resilience throughout a life spent working peacefully but passionately for equality. As a teenager and young man, Cecil Reed was the black waiter, the short-order cook, the paper carrier, the tap dancer and singer, the carpenter, and the maintenance man who learned to survive in a white society. As an adult in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, he inched his way into owning several small businesses, convincing the community to accept him and his family through hard work and creativity. When whites felt besieged by black militants in the sixties, they turned to him for less threatening advice and leadership. Reed put away his floor sander and became an inspiring speaker who crisscrossed the country offering solutions to civil rights problems. In 1966, Reed was elected to the Iowa House of Representatives, the first and only black Republican to hold this office. His next major triumph: securing a unanimous vote of approval for the state&#39;s fair housing bill. Within a year he was appointed by a Democratic governor to the Iowa Employment Security Commission, becoming the first black commissioner in America. Thus began a twenty-year career in public service in both state and federal positions that brought him into partnership with the nation&#39;s political, economic, and religious leaders. Throughout his sometimes tragic butalways hope-filled life, from shoeshine stand to Department of Labor, Cecil Reed has been a quiet, persistent, realistically-within-the-system fighter for justice. Although he epitomizes the success of his &#34;get along by getting along&#34; philosophy, he still confronts racism daily, stil</p><p>Cecil Reed currently teaches at several Office of Personnel Management centers and at the National Veterans Training Institute, University of Colorado at Denver.Reed grew up as an isolated African American in the early 20th-century Midwest. He managed to succeed in that white world, ultimately getting elected to the Iowa state legislature and then being appointed to state and federal offices with substantial responsibility over various jobs programs. Reed's trick was to become such an unthreatening, model citizen that those around him had to accept him, a philosophy he calls "bracing the system." When such notables as Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Cab Calloway were refused admission to "white" hotels, his house became their hostel. Holding menial jobs, from shining shoes to dishwashing, Reed mastered them with flair, savoring the lessons they taught, until he became a successful small businessman. When neighbors wouldn't let their kids play with his, he built a mini-amusement park, complete with a merry-go-round, midget-car racetrack and pony rides, until the white kids came to his house to play. While it is impossible, on reading this volume, not to respect Reed and his accomplishments, his lessons about "bracing the system" are of questionable relevance today.

Led by Yana Maddock and Sean Shongili, Petaybee&#x2019;s protectors prevailed.

To protect their children, Sean and Yana send them to stay with a powerful family friend on an orbiting space station. But no one realizes that Ronan and Murel hunger to discover the origins of their shape-shifting talent&#x2013;and that their search for knowledge will place them squarely in the path of peril.<br><br>Meanwhile, Petaybee is changing&#x2013;and much faster than an ordinary planet&#x2019;s natural evolution.

Sean and Yanaba made no move to leave the nursery, unable to leave the sight of their offspring, safely delivered just a few hours earlier. The babies looked up at their parents, their dark pewter eyes as brightly focused as those of any bird. Each already wore a soft crown of deep brown downy hair, but Yana would have been hard pressed to decide whose nose or cheeks they had. Everything was still rounded and squashy, unformed and utterly adorable.<br><br>Even their contented gurgles sounded for all the world like the chortle of a small and active brook swirling among stones.<br><br>"Listen to them," Yana said fondly. "They sound as if they're laughing." Then, "I thought it took longer than that for babies to do things like laugh."<br><br>Sean shrugged. "Babies who are always and entirely human perhaps. But a selkie's development is a bit different. Faster in some ways. I don't recall when exactly I developed what, but I do recall being aware of my surroundings almost at once. But as to the details, well, too bad my parents aren't still around to advise us."<br><br>But Yana, lost in wonder at the perfection of her children, answered him only with a dreamy glance. "It's almost too much joy for one person to bear," she murmured, feeling tears come to her eyes.<br>Sean took her in his arms. "Then let's share it. I smell food, and you're still feeding two--one at a time." He gave her a hug and a cuddle and, one arm draped on her shoulders, propelled her gently toward the door of the cube they had hastily attached to one side of the cabin to serve as a nursery. It was spare and spartan except for the furred cots, for it was the custom in Kilcoole to refrain from giving expecting parents items for their unborn children. A superstition really, but since Yana, before conceiving, had thought herself well past childbearing age, it seemed wise to encourage every sort of good luck.<br><br>As Sean opened the door, Nanook, his black-and-white track cat, and Coaxtl, his niece Aoifa's snow leopard, slid into the nursery. Nanook took a place under the boy's cot, while Coaxtl, after one long look at her charge, flopped beside the girl's.<br><br>"The sentries are on the job," Sean said, and continued to push his wife to the door.<br><br>"I just never thought I'd have children," Yana said, looking back over her shoulder at her twins even as Sean closed the door behind her. He left it slightly ajar so they could hear the babies if they cried out or if one of the cats needed to go out or get their attention.<br><br>No smells had been able to penetrate the cube from the main part of the house, Yana's old one-room cabin. Now, however, delicious odors of pepper and snow onions, roasting fish and unidentifiable savory spices, wafted from the stove. Over it stood the substantial and comforting bulk of Clodagh, the village's shanachie, singer of songs, bearer of culture, rememberer of history, settler of disputes, healer of wounds, and dispenser of medicines. She had also served as Yana's midwife.<br><br>"It's about time," Clodagh said, closing the lid of the pot she had been seasoning. "I thought you'd never think of yourselves. Now, sit and eat. And Yana, use that longie thing," as she pointed a ladle at a chaise longue that had recently made its appearance in their home. There was no proscription against giving an expectant mother a gift for herself. The chaise, which took up a good half of the wall next to the woodstove, had seemed too large and in the way before, but now Yana found it inviting. "Get your feet up and relax. As much as you can, that is," she added in an affectionately derisive tone.<br><br>Major Yanaba Maddock-Shongili was quite willing to assume the seat and stretch her legs. Her overtaxed muscles carried her that far mostly because of Sean's support. He rearranged her feet a trifle and sat on the end, folding his arms over his chest and giving a sigh.<br><br>"Don't you dare look at your desk," Yana said sternly.<br><br>"Even from here I can see the pile of orange flimsies, and they mean urgent."<br><br>"Nothing is so urgent as feeding the pair of you up," Clodagh said staunchly, "and there really isn't anything that damned pressing that someone else can't handle or defer--preferably until next year."<br><br>"But those hydroelectric engineers were supposed to touch down today . . . and you know how eagerly Sister Igneous Rock is awaiting them." Sean referred to the planet's geological expert and its self-proclaimed acolyte. The woman and her fellow would-be Petaybean cult followers had surprised Petaybee's longer-term residents by turning out to be quite useful once they discovered they could be of more service to Petaybee practicing their hard-science specialties instead of their misguided attempts at theology.<br><br>"Iggierock has 'em and she's dealing with them." Clodagh gave a deep chuckle. "She's near as good as I am . . . at some things. But this stew will give you much-needed energy. And we've more urgent matters to consider, such as the babies' naming song and the latchkay. I'm thinking that tomorrow will be none too soon, if Yana can make it back to the lodge and the communion cave to properly introduce your young by name to their people and their world."<br><br>"She can and she will, if I must carry her," Sean said fondly.<br><br>"I can handle it," Yana said. Fortunately, those aching muscles of hers were well toned and trained from her years in the Company Corps. "It's the babies we'll need to be carrying."<br><br>"Good," Clodagh said. "All of Kilcoole has been waiting for these young ones, but there's a time and place for their gawking and well-wishing and filling your house up with doodads for the babbies. The sooner the better, though. Have you thought of what you'll call them at all?"<br><br>She dished up three huge bowls of her concoction, and after serving the new parents, she pulled up one of the new spare chairs to the new huge kitchen table they'd been given by friends who evidently thought they were going to have dozens of children instead of just two. Clodagh passed rolls just out of the oven, and steaming through the white napkin she had covered them with.<br><br>Yana chewed quickly but deliberately, thinking hard. "Of course we've thought about it, but now that they're here, no name seems special enough. Among my mother's ancestors, you know, babies weren't named right away. High infant mortality rate was one reason, but also, her people believed a child didn't get its soul until the first time it laughed."<br><br>She and Sean looked at each other over their full spoons and smiled. "Which they've already done, and them only a few hours old," Sean said. "I can tell they're going to be quick, but then, it's well-known that all of the children born to my side of the family are very precocious."<br><br>Yana made a face at him. "Oh, in my family too, but our babies are also taught to be modest."<br><br>"You two are too giddy by half!" Clodagh mock-scolded, shaking her spoon at them. "Naming is a serious business. It should fit the baby's bloodlines--perhaps we could have names from your mother's people, Yana. There'd be a bit of novelty. It should also tell the world what the child is all about."<br><br>"This world knows what the children are about," Yana said. "It's responsible for their selkie nature, after all--well, it and their father," she added with a roll of her dark eyes at her husband. "And how advisable it is to tell the rest of the universe about that is debatable."<br><br>"No debate about it," Sean said in a tone that brooked no argument. "The universe at large does not need to know that our children mutate into seals when they submerge themselves in water any more than it needs to know that the kids inherited that trait from me."<br><br>"Well, the names don't need to come right out and say, 'I'm a selkie,' " Clodagh said. "But they should, for instance, indicate that these children have an affinity for water."<br><br>"Born for Water," Yana said with a swallow of soup.<br><br>"What?"<br><br>She gestured with a piece of roll. "I'm just thinking perhaps we should call them after the Hero Twins my mother's ancestors revered, Born for Water and Monster Slayer. Except at the moment they both seem to be Born for Water and it isn't yet clear who would be Monster Slayer."<br><br>"My money is on the wee lassie," Sean said. "She's got something of the look of you in the glint in her eyes and the set of her chin."<br><br>"She's barely got a chin," Yana said, shaking her head. "No, I think we'll have to go with the Irish side of my family this time. Here in Kilcoole where you're all Irish and Inuit, they'll blend in better with the other children that way anyway. Besides, among the Dine--my mother's people--girls all have war names like mine, and war is the last thing I want my daughter named for. Water's a bit difficult too. The sacred land of Mother's people had very little rain, or standing water either, and so they were extremely short even on fish, not to mention seals and selkies."<br><br>She stopped with her spoon halfway to her mouth. "I just had a thought. Will the babies be transforming every time they get into water? Any water? If so, I'm going to have a fine old time trying to bathe them and it won't be easy keeping their nature a family secret."<br><br>"I used to have the same problem," Sean grinned. "Until I taught myself not to fur up the moment a drop touched me. But I had no da to show me the way, and they do. Meanwhile, if you need help with the family sec...</p><h2>All-Time Best Dinners for Two</h2><p><b>Leave it to America's Test Kitchen to help you get a perfectly scaled dinner for two on the table--no guesswork required.</b><br><br>Whether you're in the mood for a takeout-inspired stir-fry or a more refined beef tenderloin, you'll find recipes to satisfy everyone's tastes.

Merral&#x2019;s only hope is that he can get to the hostages before they&#x2019;re taken to Lord-Emperor Nezhuala at the Blade of Night&#x2014;the nexus of the Dominion&#x2019;s power. But in order to get there, Merral and his crew will have to survive a perilous trip through Below Space. Meanwhile, news of the Dominion&#x2019;s defeat at Farholme reaches Ancient Earth but is tempered by the sobering truth of the enemy&#x2019;s growth and strength. It is now clear that an attack on the Assembly is imminent, but how far should the Assembly go to stop it? And does the real danger lie in the Dominion or in the subtle evil that has arrived at the heart of the Assembly itself? <i>The Infinite Day</i> is the thrilling conclusion to the epic Lamb among the Stars series that has readers and critics raving.</p><p>Born in Wales, <b>Chris Walley</b> grew up in northern England. He studied earth sciences at university and has a doctorate in geology. He taught at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon from 1980 to 1984 and then returned to Wales and spent ten years as a consultant with the oil industry.

He is currently fitting his writing in between teaching geology, environmental science, and geography at a local college. Chris and his wife live in an old cottage on the edge of Swansea.By any definition, <i>The Infinite Day</i> is a triumphant conclusion to The Lamb Among the Stars series. Since this is the final book in this series, if you&#x2019;ve been reading it, you&#x2019;re going to keep reading it. And if you haven&#x2019;t, why not? Hopefully, this final review will help persuade you. <br><br>When you&#x2019;ve been reading about a storyline and specific characters for over a thousand pages, there are certain things that are necessary to make a satisfying conclusion. <br><br>First of all, there has to be a significant payoff to the main storyline. <i>The Infinite Day</i> pays it off and gives back change. Every single element is resolved satisfactorily and then some. You want drama? It&#x2019;s here. Massive confrontation between good and evil? It&#x2019;s here. Significant sci-fi elements all tied in together? Ditto. This climax is mind-blowing. <br><br>Second of all, there has to be a satisfactory resolution for each major character&#x2019;s &#x201c;arc.&#x201d; In this series, there have been two primary protagonists&#x2014;Merral D&#x2019;Avanos and Vero&#x2014;along with two major antagonists&#x2014;Margrave Lezaroth and Lord-Emperor Nezhuala. Each one of them come to a very specific resolution, as do a number of the supporting cast. <br><br>And third... it&#x2019;s not enough to have a major dramatic climax. There must be an ending&#x2014;a very real conclusion that leaves us satisfied and happy about it all. In this case, <i>The Infinite Day</i> is beautiful. Eternity is a subject that has often been poorly portrayed in fiction. The Bible tells us that our minds can&#x2019;t even <i>imagine</i> the things God has prepared for us. So why is it so few authors have even bothered to let their imaginations run wild? After all, our wildest imagination just isn&#x2019;t wild enough. It&#x2019;s even <i>better</i> than that. Chris Walley has not been afraid to let his imagination be set free, and he&#x2019;s given us a truly inspiring vision, one that I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;ll be re-reading frequently. . . . This series ranks among the best on my shelves. <i>The Lamb Among the Stars</i> has actually lived up to its cover hype&#x2014;a triumph of imagination. Highly Recommended. (Christian Fiction Review)<br><br>Here at last we have the third volume in this epic series, larger than the others by a small margin. But what is inside blows the scope of what has gone before . . . confrontations are huge and against all odds, as we have come to expect from this author. . . . For this is the battle at the end of time, recognisable as a highly imaginative extrapolation of some of the events in the book of Revelation. But don&#x2019;t expect the tale to be familiar&#x2014;it&#x2019;s anything but. With twists and surprises at every step, depth of character rarely seen in fiction, and the very best of science fiction action, the conclusion to this massive series is as mind-blowing as it is masterful.

The man chosen for this mission is Alexander Braun---American born, Harvard educated, and a ruthless killer. British Intelligence learns of the Nazi plan. Unable to convince their American counterparts of the magnitude of the threat, they dispatch Major Michael Thatcher to track down Braun. The trail leads to Rhode Island, where Lydia Cole, a young heiress, has unwittingly taken Braun back into her life. Braun is forced to run, and there is one place where he must go--Los Alamos, home of the Manhattan Project. On July 16, 1945, the world&#39;s first atomic bomb is tested - code named Trinity. In the days that follow, four people - a tenacious British investigator, a determined young woman, a killer, and the spy who could compromise America&#39;s greatest scientific endeavor - will have a fateful rendezvous, all vying for control of the secret that will shape the world.</p><p>As a fighter pilot in the US Air Force, award-winning novelist Ward Larsen flew over twenty combat missions in Desert Storm. He has also been a federal law enforcement officer and an aircraft accident investigator. Presently captain for a major airline, he resides with his family in Florida. He is also the author of The Perfect Assassin and Stealing Trinity.Larsen (<i>The Perfect Assassin</i>) links the torpedoing of the USS <i>Indianapolis</i> shortly after the ship delivers an atomic bomb to the island of Tinian in the South Pacific to a Nazi plot in his second thriller, set in the waning days of WWII. Maj. Michael Thatcher, a tenacious British officer whose job is to hunt down Nazi spies, is intrigued when the words Manhattan Project come up in one of his interrogations. Meanwhile, in Germany, Col. Hans Gruber knows that a sleeper spy, Die Wespe, who's been working on the atomic bomb project in Los Alamos, must be smuggled out of the U.S. with his stolen plans so that those Nazis who survive the war can rearm and continue their goal of world domination. Charged with this mission is Capt. Alexander Braun, an American fighting in the German army. Braun is clever and ruthless, but once Thatcher catches his scent, he won't rest until Braun is captured or killed.

Beaufils&#x2019;s innocence never fails to make his companions grin, but his fresh outlook on the world&#x2019;s peculiarities turns out to be more of a gift than a curse as they encounter unexpected friends and foes.<br><br>With his constant stream of wise fools and foolish wise men, holy hermits and others of rather less holiness, plotting magicians and conniving Ladies, Gerald Morris infuses these medieval stories with a riotous humor all his own.</p><p>When Gerald Morris was in fifth grade he loved Greek and Norse mythology and before long was retelling the stories to his younger sister and then to neighborhood kids. He began carrying a notebook in which he kept some of the details related to the different stories. The joy he found in retelling those myths continued when he discovered other stories. According to Gerald Morris, &#x201c;I never lost my love of retelling the old stories. When I found Arthurian literature, years later, I knew at once that I wanted to retell those grand tales. So I pulled out my notebook . . . I retell the tales, peopling them with characters that I at least find easier to recognize, and let the magic of the Arthurian tradition go where it will.&#x201d; Gerald Morris lives in Wausau, Wisconsin, with his wife and their three children. In addition to writing he serves as a minister in a church.Grade 5 Up&#x2013;Morris continues his tradition of effectively translating the tales of King Arthur for a new generation of readers. Beaufils spends the first 17 years of his life in a forest cottage with his loving mother, never meeting another human being. Then, upon her urging, he goes forth into the world of men, to seek out King Arthur's court and his erstwhile father. This unique background makes the protagonist the perfect foil for the other characters' antics. He bumbles along, innocently taming evil as he seeks his father and helps his friends complete their own quests. While less mature readers will be carried away by the compelling story line and interesting characters, more sophisticated teens will appreciate the dry wit with which Morris reveals his character's flaws. A heartwarming and thought-provoking tale, this story is sure to entertain readers.<i>&#x2013;Nicki Clausen-Grace, Carillon Elementary School, Oviedo, FL</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Now this brazen piracy is threatening Earth with total extinction. It is up to the Ring, a secret society of witches and warlocks dedicated to the continuance and well-being of mankind, to fight the virtuous, unbendingly traditional stronghold of Arth with an arsenal of psychological sabotage, internal dissension -- and kamikaze sex ...</p><p>Diana Wynne Jones is Britain&#39;s foremost writer of children&#39;s fantasy, including the World Fantasy Award-nominated Archer&#39;s Goon, which was made into a six-part BBC TV series, and the Guardian Award-winning Charmed Life.The acclaimed author of children's fiction has turned her considerable talents to writing for adults, and has come up with a buoyant and boisterous romp through several universes. Unbeknownst to most people, a group of benevolent witches are hard at work keeping the world--and Great Britain in particular--safe from evil and destruction. Meanwhile, from their vantage point in another universe, the celibate magicians of Arth are busy spying on earth, and sending any likely-seeming ideas and inventions back to their own home planet, a Pentarchy--a world where magic is rife and originality is absent. Not satisfied with simply stealing ideas that already exist, Arth's magicians have taken to dispatching various disasters to earth (the latest is global warming) in order to learn from its inhabitants' reactions. Fed up with Arth's practice of using their world as a giant lab animal, earth's witches fill a magical bus with enchantresses and send it to Arth, with orders to make as much trouble as possible. They do. Matters are further complicated when a young woman (who may or may not be an embodiment of the Great Goddess) stows herself and her toddler son onto the witches' bus. Because there are a great many details that must be established before Jones can begin telling her story, the novel's first few chapters are relatively slow going. However, once the large cast of characters has been introduced and the three distinct worlds sketched out, the narrative careens ahead at a merry, headlong pace. Jones's sly sense of humor and her accurate, affectionate depiction of relations between women and men give an extra kick to this effervescent tale. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mary Ellen Mark: Tiny, Streetwise Revisited</h2><p>In 1988, Mary Ellen Mark published a poignant document of a fiercely independent group of homeless and troubled youth living in Seattle as pimps, prostitutes, panhandlers and small-time drug dealers. Critically acclaimed, &#34;Streetwise&#34; introduced us to individuals who were not easily forgotten, including &#34;Tiny&#34; (Erin Blackwell)--a 13-year-old prostitute with dreams of a horse farm, diamonds and furs, and a baby of her own. Since meeting Tiny 30 years ago, Mark has continued to photograph her, creating what has become one of Mark&#39;s most significant and long-term projects. Now 43, Tiny has ten children and her life has unfolded in unexpected ways, which together speak to issues of poverty, class, race and addiction. This significantly expanded iteration of the classic monograph presents the iconic work of the first edition along with Mark&#39;s moving and intimate body of work on Tiny, most of which is previously unpublished. Texts and captions are drawn from conversations between Tiny and Mary Ellen Mark as well as Mark&#39;s husband, the filmmaker Martin Bell, who made the landmark film, &#34;Streetwise.&#34; &#34;Tiny, Streetwise Revisited&#34; provides a powerful education about one of the more complex sides of American life, as well as insight into the unique relationship sustained between artist and subject for over 30 years.Mary Ellen Mark (1940-2015) was a legendary American photographer known for her photojournalism and portraiture.

Her photo essay on runaway children in Seattle became the basis of the Academy Award&#x2013;nominated film Streetwise, directed and photographed by her husband Martin Bell, and was published in book form in 1988. Mark published twenty-one books, including American Odyssey (Aperture, 1999), Twins (Aperture, 2003), Exposure (2005), Seen Behind the Scene (2009), Prom (2012), and Tiny: Streetwise Revisited (Aperture, 2015).

It read in part: &#x201c;I stand by the convictions I expressed in my &#x2018;June Second Hunger Strike Declaration&#x2019; twenty years ago&#x2014;I have no enemies and no hatred. None of the police who monitored, arrested, and interrogated me, none of the prosecutors who indicted me, and none of the judges who judged me are my enemies.&#x201d;</p><p><br></p><p><br>That statement is one of the pieces in this book, which includes writings spanning two decades, providing insight into all aspects of Chinese life. These works not only chronicle a leading dissident&#x2019;s struggle against tyranny but enrich the record of universal longing for freedom and dignity. Liu speaks pragmatically, yet with deep-seated passion, about peasant land disputes, the Han Chinese in Tibet, child slavery, the CCP&#x2019;s Olympic strategy, the Internet in China, the contemporary craze for Confucius, and the Tiananmen massacre. Also presented are poems written for his wife, Liu Xia, public documents, and a foreword by V�clav Havel.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br>This collection is an aid to reflection for Western readers who might take for granted the values Liu has dedicated his life to achieving for his homeland.</p></p><p>Liu Xiaobo, winner of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, is a Chinese writer and human rights activist.The message contained in this book is so powerful that Liu has been imprisoned solely for exercising his right to free expression. The awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Liu is a testament to the strength of his message and to all the Chinese activists who sacrificed their lives and so much else in the pursuit of freedom and democracy in China. The essays of Liu Xiaobo have inspired freedom loving people not only in China but around the world. (Nancy Pelosi, House Democratic Leader)<br><br>Liu Xiaobo insists on "living in truth." Each time I re-read his astute essays and merciless self-dissections, I am struck again: here truly is a different kind of Chinese intellectual. The essential value of the essays in this volume springs from that very source: Liu Xiaobo lives in truth; he is different. (Ding Zilin, Founder of the Tiananmen Mothers)<br><br>Presented in a lucid and persuasive manner with obvious but well restrained moral passion, this book offers a leading Chinese intellectual dissident's thoughts over the past two decades on his persistent efforts to bring about a free, democratic and civilized China. Liu's engag� writings keep alive the modern Chinese tradition of intellectual pursuit of liberal democracy and constitute another page of individual struggle for human freedom and dignity. This book is for anyone who is concerned with a better China and a better world. (Josephine Chiu-Duke, University of British Colombia)<br><br>The massacre in Beijing in 1989 turned Liu Xiaobo, almost literally overnight, toward passionate pursuit of democracy, constitutional government, and respect for the dignity of the individual person. The quest has sent him to prison four times, yet he insists that he "has no enemies." Some day, I am sure, his works will be available in China for his fellow citizens to read and discuss. He has never let go of the present, and is sure to win the future. He belongs to China--just as China, in part, belongs to him. (Pu Zhiqiang, rights lawyer, Beijing)<br><br>The voice of Liu Xiaobo, though silenced in his motherland, is a voice that conveys the long-cherished aspirations of the Chinese people. It is our good fortune that we now have this voice in English translation which, while faithful to the original meaning, also preserves the power of his original message. (Ying-shih Yu, Princeton University)<br><br>Liu Xiaobo's brilliant essays express more than political dissidence in China. They do that too, heroically. But they are also the work of a first rate literary intellectual, whose ideas are of universal value. In three words: sharp, witty, and above all, humane. (Ian Buruma, author of Bad Elements: Chinese Rebels from Los Angeles to Beijing)<br><br>I am happy to learn that the selected writings of Liu Xiaobo are being published in a book entitled No Enemies, No Hatred. In 2008, when hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and concerned citizens inspired by Liu Xiaobo signed Charter 08, calling for democracy and freedom in China, I was personally moved and expressed my admiration for their courage and their goals in public. The international community also recognized Liu Xiaobo's valuable contribution in urging China to take steps towards political, legal and constitutional reforms by supporting the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to him in 2010. Considering the writer himself remains imprisoned, this book is a powerful reminder of his courage and his vision for a new China. I believe that in the coming years, future generations of Chinese will enjoy the fruits of the efforts that Chinese citizens today are making towards the introduction of a more open and responsible governance. I would also like to take this opportunity to renew my call to the Chinese government to release him and other prisoners of conscience. (The Dalai Lama)<br><br>Freedom of expression may be irritating to some, but its absence is harmful to all. Without the freedom of expression there can be no lasting progress because without critical voices in the society there is no protection against error and abuse in the exercise of power. Liu Xiaobo is paying a harsh price for speaking out. I invite you to read his work, as a tribute to his courage, and as an inspiration for your own. (Thorbj�rn Jagland, Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee)<br><br>During the Nobel ceremony in December 2010, an empty chair was placed in Oslo City Hall to honor Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo, whose outspokenness not only earned him the prize but a prison term as well. The award catapulted him to international stardom, shining a penetrating light on his own imprisonment much as he had often shined light on the troubles of his country. These essays provide an up-to-date account of the country's current political and cultural climate, touching on a wide array of issues from the plight of the Chinese farmer to the eroding spirituality of Chinese youth. The essays are tempered by poems, many of which are interwoven throughout the book to provide a much-needed calming effect. Yet Liu Xiaobo's widespread appeal comes not from his poetry, but in his ability to move beyond platitudes and deal in personal stories--e.g., the tale of a local police department's gross mishandling of the rape and murder of a 15-year-old girl and the protests that developed soon after. Equally powerful is the author's assault on China's closed society, noting that while prostitution is technically illegal in China, thanks to sexual suppression, China is now "number one in the world."...For the world that knew Liu Xiaobo only for his empty chair in Oslo, this much-needed book fills the void. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i> 2011-10-01)<br><br>Liu, the 2010 Nobel Peace laureate currently imprisoned in China for "incitement to subvert state power," registers wide-ranging dissent against the Chinese system in these withering essays and stark poems ("From the grins of corpses/ you've learned/ that it is only death/ that never fails"). Included are manifestos and trial statements denouncing China's dictatorship and calling for human rights, free speech, and democracy. Other pieces criticize the subtler corruptions of a repressive society: the frenzied nationalism of the Beijing Olympics; mass evictions and child slavery; soulless urban youth; the craze for Confucius, whom the author views as a mediocrity whose legacy is a Chinese "slave mentality"; the guilty compromises that prodemocracy leaders--himself included--make to protect themselves. Liu's alienation comes through in his strong, if conflicted, identification with Western ideals, Madisonian politics, and crypto-Catholic religiosity ("we will have passion, miracles and beauty as long as we have the example of Jesus Christ")...Though personal and idiosyncratic at times, Liu's ringing universalist defense of democratic rights and freedoms will resonate with American readers. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2011-10-03)</p><h2>Empire by Default: The Spanish-American War and the Dawn of the American Century</h2><p>The definitive version of the Spanish-American War as well as a dramatic account of America's emergence as a global power.<br></p><p>On the centennial of the Spanish-American War, the short and confusing conflict receives comprehensive treatment in a narrative of more than 600 pages. At the close of the 19th century, Americans were looking outward at the world. In a precursor to the foreign involvement of the next century the U.S. Navy found itself fighting in the Philippines, and the infantry (and Theodore Roosevelt&#39;s volunteer cavalrymen) entered combat (and battle illness) on the island of Cuba. The Spanish-American War has often been overlooked as an oddity, but those who want to understand its role in American history now have access to what may stand as the definitive history of the war that led to the United States being regarded as a world power.Historian Musicant (Divided Waters, 1995) offers a detailed examination of the American war that catapulted the nation to imperial status. Beginning with the political conflicts that brought William McKinley to the presidency, Musicant offers a portrait of a nation increasingly torn between the desire for isolation and the yearning for a place on the international stage. That conflict was at first fought out in the nation's newspapers, which, by focusing on Spanish atrocities against Cubans fighting for independence, managed to gradually sway public opinion toward involvements abroad. The sinking of the American warship Maine in the harbor of Havana (blamed, without much evidence, on a Spanish mine), pushed America over the edge, and a reluctant McKinley was compelled to declare war on Spain. The war itself lasted less than a year (from April 21, 1898, to March 19, 1899) and featured only a few large-scale battles, but Musicant is able to wring considerable drama from this thorough narrative of events. He draws heavily on primary American and Spanish sources, including the memoirs of Teddy Roosevelt, who led the famous charge up San Juan Hill. As Musicant points out, that charge was far bloodier than suspected; indeed, raw American troops often found themselves facing well-entrenched foes. At sea it was a different story: Admiral Dewey demolished an entire Spanish squadron at Manila Bay, securing the Philippines as American troops were seizing Cuba. While his narrative of the war is thorough, clear, and vivid, Musicant seems to scant the war's larger meanings, such as Roosevelt's 1900 election as vice president and a festering guerrilla war in the Philippines. The conclusion is only weak by comparison, however, as Musicant offers a meticulous yet exciting narrative of a small war that carried large implications for the nation's future.

Waller tells how British Prime Minister Chamberlain mismanaged British intelligence which contributed to the debacle at Munich. and scores of other stories during the war.</p><p>John H. Waller was inspector general of the Central Intelligence Agency, retiring in 1980.Outdoing the best spy fiction, former CIA inspector general Waller (Beyond the Khyber Pass, 1990, etc.) tells a series of riveting stories about the hidden war between the Germans and the Allies in WW II. From the beginning, the intelligence war was a central element of the conflict. Waller relates some well-known stories, like the breaking of the British naval fleet codes by the Germans, which contributed to the great success of the Nazi U-boat effort, and the similar breaking of the German Enigma enciphering machine by Allied intelligence, which allowed the British to anticipate German strategy on the continent. He also offers speculations on the intelligence background of WW II riddles like the Hess flight to Scotland and the assassination of Reinhold Heydrich, one of the most violent and ambitious members of Himmler's inner circle. However, Waller also travels some less familiar ground, particularly in his detailed profile of Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, the brilliant, enigmatic head of the Abwehr, the military intelligence unit of the German Ministry of War. Canaris despised Nazism, secretly assisted the Allied war effort, and ultimately participated in the doomed 1944 attempt to assassinate Hitler. Waller also describes Operation X, which used Pius XII, an old friend of Canaris's, to help relay messages from the German Resistance movement to British intelligence; the ``Venlo incident'' in 1939, which cost Britain virtually its entire intelligence network on the continent; Allen Dulles's secret work as a ``special representative'' of FDR in Switzerland; and the intelligence intrigues surrounding the implementation of Hitler's invasion of France and his plan to invade the Soviet Union. More than a deft account of some some intriguing spy stories, Waller's history reminds us how crucial intelligence operations were to the war in Europe and to the Allies' ultimate success. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Fauvist color experiments, luminous landscapes inspired by Emersonian transcendentalism, semi-abstracts fusing geometry with German military symbols, Amerindian visionsall these were signposts in the spiritual quest of a self-exiled refugee from Maine who roamed Paris, Berlin, Taos and Mexico, only to return to his New England roots. Crisply written and splendidly illustrated, Scott's bright narrative lets us appreciate the varied facets of this ever-wandering artist. Editor of Hartley's essays and collected poems, she demonstrates how strikingly original he was, for example, in the "magic mountain" landscapes of New England, or the late portraits of gawky, square-shouldered men that propelled the human figure into the realm of religious painting. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.The richness of Marsden Hartley's paintings is well presented here, in both the lush reproductions of his work and in the warmly appreciative critical/biographical text. Having previously edited Hartley's poems and essays, Scott brings insight to the artist and his images. The notion that art, particularly painting, is a blend of imagination, appropriation from other artists, and the painter's persona, is seamlessly demonstrated through words and visuals. Artists better known than Hartley might envy the fine examination of a painter's inspiration and sense of place that Scott gives us. Highly recommended.

John F. Kennedy&#x2019;s assassination. 9/11. John Hagee maintains that these American tragedies all have one element in common: they were unthinkable. And in the opening pages of his newest book, <i>Can America Survive?<b> </b></i>Hagee uses these tragedies to prove two points: that the unthinkable can happen and, given the right conditions, the unthinkable can quickly become the <i>inevitable</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>In <i>Can America Survive?</i> Hagee asserts that the seeds for tragedy are once again being sown, evidenced by the disturbing economic, geopolitical, and religious trends that now threaten to dismantle the very nation itself. &#x201c;Think it can&#x2019;t happen?&#x201d; Hagee asks in a theme repeated throughout the book. &#x201c;Think again.&#x201d; Indeed, Hagee presents alarming examples of recent events, current research, scientific evidence, and biblical prophecy that are gathering to create a &#x201c;perfect storm&#x201d; that could bring down the &#x201c;unsinkable&#x201d; United States of America including:<br><br> <ul> <li>The U.S.&#x2019;s negligent handling of Israel, and history&#x2019;s evidence of the danger to any nation that challenges Israel&#x2019;s God-mandated right to exist </li><li>The dangerous belittling of Iran&#x2019;s nuclear threat by careless spy agencies&#x2014;and the super-weapon that could stop the U.S. in its tracks <i>instantly</i> </li><li>The chilling biblical prophecy that confirms Iran as one of six countries that will form an Islamic military force &#x201c;as a cloud to cover the land&#x201d; </li><li>The real $2.5 trillion price tag of healthcare reform, the international currency shifts, and the national economic trends that are poised to bring about the death of the American dollar </li><li>The criminalization of Christianity around the world;</li></ul><b><i>Can America Survive? </i></b>is not just a warning. It is a wake-up call and a rallying cry to Christian citizens everywhere to prevent the next unthinkable American disaster. After all, as Hagee points out, &#x201c;those who do not remember the mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat them in the future.&#x201d; Think it can&#x2019;t happen? Think again.</p><p><b>Pastor John Hagee</b> is the founder and senior pastor of Cornerstone Church in San Antonio, Texas, a non-denominational evangelical church with more than 19,000 active members.&nbsp;He is the founder and chairman of Christians United for Israel. He is also the president and C.E.O. of John Hagee Ministries, which telecasts his national radio and television ministry throughout America and can be seen weekly in 99 million homes and in more than 200 nations worldwide. <br><br>John Hagee graduated from Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas, then earned his Masters Degree from North Texas University.

Kennedy was shot in Dallas, Texas? If you were alive on planet Earth, you know exactly where you were and what you were doing when Walter Cronkite took off his thick black glasses and announced to America, &#x201c;John F. Kennedy, president of the United States, died at 1:00 p.m. Central Standard Time.&#x201d;<br><br>He paused and looked again at the studio clock. &#x201c;Some thirty-eight minutes ago.&#x201d; The seasoned newscaster momentarily lost his composure, winced, and cleared his throat before resuming with the observation that Vice President Lyndon Johnson would take the oath of office to become the thirty-sixth president of the United States.<br><br>The heart of America was broken!<br><br>We had been swept up in the dream that was Camelot. We wept as a nation when Jackie walked into the Capitol Rotunda with Caroline and kissed the flag-draped coffin of JFK. His cortege of matched, prancing black horses pulled the caisson past the White House and the Capitol for the final time while John-John saluted his father and our president with a final farewell. It was a tragic and heartbreaking moment in history America will never forget! There is no greater agony of the soul than to live in the wonder of what might have been.<br><br>Where were you on 9/11?<br><br>What did you feel when you watched radical Islamic terrorists fly hijacked commercial airlines as missiles of death into the Twin Towers in New York City?<br><br>What did you feel when you saw fellow Americans jumping to their horrific and gruesome deaths from hundreds of feet in the air in a futile attempt to escape the blazing inferno?<br><br>Every living soul was someone&#x2019;s beloved father or mother, someone&#x2019;s loving husband or wife, someone&#x2019;s cherished son or daughter that would never come home again. Their families would forever after gather on special days of celebration&#x2014;Thanksgiving, Christmas, birthdays, and anniversaries&#x2014;and look with pain and heartache at their pictures with tearful eyes knowing that the nightmare of 9/11 would never end in their lifetime.<br><br>What did you feel as you watched the Twin Towers implode, floor after floor, and in a handful of thundering seconds see concrete, steel, and the lives of three thousand fellow Americans crushed together into an eternal monument of pain and suffering.<br><br>Brave New York City firefighters dashed into the blazing inferno and gave their lives trying to save the lives of others. &#x201c;Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one&#x2019;s life for his friends&#x201d; (John 15:13 NKJV).<br><br>They gave their all without hesitation. They died and will forever remain American heroes. We make a living by what we get out of life, but we make a life by what we give. No man was ever honored by what he received. Honor is the reward for what he gave. The New York City firefighters gave their all!<br><br>Do you remember American citizens running in terror down the streets of New York City, screaming as a massive mushroom cloud of dust from the Twin Towers filled the air and turned a golden day into darkest night? For the first time since the British burned the White House in 1813, we had been attacked in the continental United States&#x2014;the land of the free and the home of the brave.<br><br>The American illusion of being untouchable by foreign military powers was shattered in a day by the agents of radical Islam. America would never be the same!<br><br>It couldn&#x2019;t happen... but it did happen!<br><br><b><b>THE PERFECT STORM</b></b><br><br>On April 12, 1912, the <i>Titanic</i> raced through the icy waters of the Atlantic trying to set a new transatlantic speed record. This mountain of steel and mechanical genius had been pronounced &#x201c;the unsinkable ship!&#x201d;<br><br>Minutes before the <i>Titanic</i> struck the iceberg, some of the richest and most powerful people in the world danced the night away, unaware that disaster was imminent and that the Angel of Death was aboard. They would have gladly traded their power and their fortunes for a crude lifeboat, but none was available for the more than 1,500 souls who drowned in the frigid waters of the Atlantic on this night of unspeakable disaster.<br><br>The demons of denial pushed the agony and horror off the celebrated ship. Even after striking the iceberg and with the ship sinking by the head and taking on tons of water, Mr. J. Bruce Ismay, president of the company that owned the <i>Titanic</i>, pledged to his powerful passengers: &#x201c;Not to worry, all is well. This ship is unsinkable and it&#x2019;s clear as far as the eye can see.&#x201d;<br><br>That message was so desired by the masses that twenty-four hours after the <i>Titanic</i> was at the bottom of the ocean, twenty-four hours after 1,522 souls had slipped into eternity the headlines in the New York paper screamed: &#x201c;All Saved from Titanic After Collision.&#x201d;<br><br>Telegrams were received reading, &#x201c;All Titanic Passengers Are Safe!&#x201d; Another telegram read, &#x201c;The Virginian Is Towing Titanic into Halifax.&#x201d; There was a total and complete denial of reality.<br><br>It couldn&#x2019;t happen... but it did happen!<br><br>The unthinkable horror became reality.<br><br>The unbelievable nightmare was a fact!<br><br>How did it happen?<br><br>Why did it happen?<br><br>It happened because a perfect storm of human error driven by the winds of complacency and overconfidence birthed an unspeakable disaster.<br><br>First, the well-known fact that there were not enough lifeboats&#x2014;because the <i>Titanic</i> was said to be &#x201c;unsinkable,&#x201d; which proved to be absolutely false&#x2014;led to the deaths of many souls.<br><br>Second, there was no one to receive the distress signal from the <i>Titanic</i> as it was sinking because all ships closed their telegraph systems at midnight. This maritime law was promptly changed after the <i>Titanic</i> disaster so that all ships at sea would have an operator on duty twenty-four hours a day.<br><br>Third, had there been a ship nearby, the <i>Titanic</i> had no red flares that were the international maritime signal for &#x201c;emergency&#x201d; or &#x201c;need help.&#x201d; The <i>Titanic</i> had only white phosphorus flares used for many things, but never danger.<br><br>Think of it!<br><br>If they had had but one red flare, the ship <i>California</i>, which was less than ten miles away, might have seen it. It could have come quickly to the rescue and not one life would have been lost. One red flare could have saved 1,522 lives!<br><br>Fourth, there were no binoculars available to the watchmen in the crow&#x2019;s nest staring into the frigid and clear night looking for any sign of danger. When the watchmen spotted the massive iceberg by natural sight, it was too late.<br><br>With one pair of binoculars, they could have seen the iceberg in plenty of time to turn the ship away from danger and the certain death lurking beneath the icy water. One set of binoculars could have saved 1,522 lives.<br><br>Last, it was customary for all ships to measure the water temperature when in this part of the ocean. Water in the 30-degree range meant icebergs were near. They read water temperature by dropping a canvas bag overboard by rope and reading the seawater with a thermometer. The temperature of the seawater was then entered into the logbook for the captain of the ship to read.<br><br>In Senate hearings, it was discovered that the rope that let the canvas bag overboard was too short to reach the water in the ocean. It was too short because this was the largest ship in the world. The crew made a small but deadly miscalculation.<br><br>The seaman in charge of taking the temperature of the seawater filled the canvas bag with drinking water taken from the ship. When the captain read the temperature report in the log, there was absolutely no concern of danger.<br><br>Think of it!<br><br>Fifteen hundred and twenty-two of the most powerful people on the earth could have been saved if the rope had been long enough.<br><br>Why do I belabor this point?<br><br>Because America, believed to be the most powerful and &#x201c;unsinkable&#x201d; nation on the face of the earth, is now racing across the stage of history in a similar perfect storm&#x2014;this one driven by the winds of political correctness, economic meltdowns leading to the death of the dollar, the rejection of Israel, the maniacal nuclear ambitions of the theocratic dictatorship in Iran, the ten prophetic signs that we are the terminal generation now being fulfilled in Bible prophecy for the first time in world history, and the very real fact that in the near future planet Earth is going to experience, on a specific day, global ecological disaster in which one-third of humanity will die.<br><br>Could this specific day be 12/12/12? Before you throw this book into the fire, read the final chapter. The concepts are not mine, but those of St. John on the Isle of Patmos in the book of Revelation.<br><br><i>So the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, were released to kill a third of mankind.</i><br><br><i>&#x2014;Revelation 9:15 NKJV</i><br><br>Think it can&#x2019;t happen?<br><br>Think again!<br><br>St. John the Revelator confirms to his readers in all generations that follow him until the end of days ...<br><br><i>These words</i> are <i>faithful and true ... Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.</i><br><br><i>&#x2014;Revelation 22:6-7 NKJV</i><br><br>America and Western civilization have made and are making a series of serious blunders that are now pushing America in the twenty-first century toward the edge of the abyss. It is far more than a banking crisis!<br><br>It is far more than just a credit crunch!<br><br>It is a perfect storm that has been brewing for centuries that is about to explode in all its fury affecting the lives of every person on planet Earth.<br><br><b><b>IN THE THROES OF DEATH AND BIRTH</b></b><br><br>In America, we are watching the <i>death</i> of capitalism and the <i>birth</i> of European socialism; because of our titanic debt, we are watching the <i>death</i> of the dollar. The <i>birth</i> of nuclear warfare in the Middle East with a nuclear Iran will change the world forever!<br><br>We are watching the <i>birth</i> of a shadow government of Czars that are not answerable to Congress and therefore escape the protections of the Constitution of the United States. This is not a government of &#x201c;We the People.&#x201d; We are watching the <i>birth</i> of a New World Order where nations surrender their sovereignty and follow a Global Czar that will be the world&#x2019;s new Caesar. The Bible calls him the Antichrist.<br><br>With geopolitical and financial danger signals in abundance the word of absolute denial we get from Washington is &#x201c;All is well, America is the unsinkable nation, entertain yourselves by shuffling deck chairs on the <i>Titanic</i> while the band plays on.&#x201d;<br><br>Think it can&#x2019;t happen?<br><br>Think again!<br><br>Consider the following facts: Our recent credit crisis has revealed that the Federal Reserve, which no one in America controls, has loaned $2 trillion in the span of two months but will not tell us to whom they loaned the money. Who asked for it? Who authorized the loan? <i>You</i>, the taxpayers of America, will most certainly pay for it.<br><br>America has ceased to be a producer nation and has become a consumer nation. Think what that could mean in a time of war for our national defense when we have to get what we need to defend ourselves from a nation or nations hostile to the United States.<br><br>We have intentionally dumbed down our schools, ignored our history, and no longer teach our students the founding principles of America. Students graduate who cannot read, write, or speak intelligently. A significant percentage do not graduate from high school, thus forever joining the legions of the unemployed and poverty-stricken who will be slaves of the state for life!<br><br>America lives under the iron fist of judicial tyranny. Federal judges who are not elected by the people rule over the will of the people after they go to the polls and vote. We do not have a government &#x201c;of the people, by the people, and for the people.&#x201d; Why can&#x2019;t we have the right to vote federal judges off the bench?<br><br>The prophet Isaiah writes:<br><br><i>Woe to those who decree unrighteous decrees, Who write misfortune</i>, Which <i>they have prescribed.</i><br><br><i>&#x2014;Isaiah 10:1 NKJV</i><br><br>Abortion is an unrighteous decree!<br><br><i>Roe v. Wade</i> has made it possible for 40 million babies to be murdered in the wombs of their mothers. Mother Teresa said, &#x201c;The nation that kills its unborn has lost its soul.&#x201d; I agree!<br><br>Think about it!<br><br>Forty million souls is a river of blood that cries out to God for justice.<br><br><i>Then the LORD said to Cain ... &#x201c;What have you done? The voice of your brother&#x2019;s blood cries out to Me from the ground. &#x201c;</i><br><br><i>&#x2014;Genesis 4:9-10 NKJV</i><br><br>A new CNN poll finds that 61 percent of Americans oppose taxpayer funding of abortion. But we know from comments of top White House officials that the president himself will intervene behind the scenes to make sure that ObamaCare subsidizes abortion on demand. (The poll also found that 63 percent of Americans think that abortion should be illegal in most cases.)1 Let me tell you why Social Security is broken and will remain broken. <i>Abortion!</i><br><br>The Baby Boomers are retiring and there is no &#x201c;next generation&#x201d; to pay the tab for Social Security. They have been killed under the banner of the &#x201c;right to choose.&#x201d;<br><br>This infamous law that celebrates <i>death</i> over life will be one of the principal causes for the <i>death of the dollar!</i> Why? Because capitalism thrives on supply and demand! If there is no demand for a product, the economic engines of America stop!<br><br>Fact! There will be no demand from 40 million Americans for new homes, new cars, or college educations. Why? They have been murdered through abortion!<br><br>Our universities and colleges are now filled with students recruited from foreign countries. They have no love or loyalty to America. They come from the global community with the &#x201c;One World&#x201d; view. They could not care less if America surrenders its sovereignty to the United Nations, and they are here by the millions. Is the big picture coming together?<br><br>We have mainstreamed Marxist organizations, like ACORN, which are corrupting the political process of fair and open elections. Even after being caught on film educating prostitutes and their pimps on how to dodge taxation from the IRS and how to run a brothel with underage children, some U.S. congressmen defend this toxic and corrupt organization. Why do they have such a vested interest in the preservation of Acorn?<br><br>Why doesn&#x2019;t someone in Congress call for a full investigation by the FBI?<br><br>If there is no confidence in the political process through which we elect our leaders, there can be no confidence in government.<br><br><b><b>A NATION OF CONSUMERS</b></b><br><br>Long before America was founded, the Greeks decided that a democracy could never work. Their logic was that once the citizens discovered they could vote themselves money from the public treasury, their numbers and demands would grow until they outnumbered the financial producers in any democracy, bringing bankruptcy to the state.

The first of these novels, <i>Rowan of Rin, </i>won the Children's Book Council of Australia Book of the Year for Younger Readers Award when it was first published. In fact, Emily Rodda has won the Children's Book Council of Australia Book of the Year Award an unprecedented five times. A former editor, Ms. Rodda is also the best-selling author of adult mysteries under the name Jennifer Rowe. She lives in Australia.<p></p>Gr. 3-6. Rodda's new fantasy-adventure series (three other titles are to follow within a year) introduces the people of Rin, who live in the shadow of the Mountain ruled by a fierce but unseen dragon. When the community's water source suddenly dries up, and the dragon ceases his daily roars, some of the bravest villagers prepare to travel up the Mountain to investigate the problem. Young Rowan, a herder who fears he will never be as brave as his late father, must accompany the group because only he can make the magical map reveal its necessary clues. One by one, each strong adventurer confronts his own greatest fears and turns back, leaving only Rowan to deal with the fire-breathing dragon on the summit. Readers would have been satisfied had they simply been given an exciting adventure story. But this talented Australian writer has also given them a fully conceived fantasy world complete with its own flora and fauna, a well-developed back story, and fascinating characters. This tightly plotted mystery sprinkled with clever rhyming clues is somewhat reminiscent of Tom McGowen's the Magician's Apprentice series (1987), and it should be popular with young readers everywhere. <i>Kay Weisman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

No one knows that better than Albert Morris, a brash investigator with a knack for trouble, who has sent his own duplicates into deadly peril more times than he cares to remember.\<br><br>But when Morris takes on a ring of bootleggers making illegal copies of a famous actress, he stumbles upon a secret so explosive it has incited open warfare on the streets of Dittotown. <br>Dr. Yosil Maharal, a brilliant researcher in artificial intelligence, has suddenly vanished, just as he is on the verge of a revolutionary scientific breakthrough. Maharal's daughter, Ritu, believes he has been kidnapped-or worse.

In <i>Kiln People</i>, David Brin's sci-fi-meets-noir novel, this wish has come true. In Brin's imagined future, folks are able to make inexpensive, disposable clay copies of themselves. These golems or "dittos" live for a single day to serve their creator, who can then choose whether or not to "inload" the memories of the ditto's brief life. But private investigator Albert Morris gets more than he, or his "ditective" copies, bargain for when he signs on to help solve the mysterious disappearance of Universal Kilns' co-founder Yasil Maharal--the father of dittotech.<p> Brin successfully interweaves plot lines as numerous as our hero's ditectives and doggedly sticks to the rules of his created dittotech while Morris's "realflesh" and clay manifestations slowly unravel the dangerous secret behind Maharal's disappearance. As Brin juggles his multiple protagonists and antagonists, he urges the reader to question notions of memory, individualism, and technology, and to answer the schizoid question "which 'you' is 'you?'" Brin's enjoyment is evident as he plays with his terracotta creations' existential angst and simultaneously deconstructs the familiar streetwise detective meme--complete with a multilayered ending. Overall, <i>Kiln People</i> is a fun read, with a good balance of hard science fiction and pop sensibility. <i>--Jeremy Pugh</i></p>David Brin is the author of more than a dozen novels, including six volumes in his award-winning Uplift saga, as well as two short story collections and a nonfiction work, <i>The Transparent Society</i>, about privacy in the electronic age.

He was born from American horse racing royalty -- Compliance (his father was Kentucky Derby-winner Northern Dancer; his great-grandfather Native Dancer, the Preakness and Belmont Stakes winner) and Listen Lady (great-granddaughter of Native Dancer). Even before his birth, the hopes (not to mention the bill for his planned production) for Zippy Chippy were high. His pedigree was horse racing gold: Northern Dancer, Man o' War, Count Fleet, Bold Ruler, War Admiral, and Buckpasser were all ancestors. His success and glory seemed inevitable.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But moments after his birth, Zippy Chippy struggled to his feet, took two steps forward . . . and stopped dead in his tracks. He looked around, took in his surroundings, maybe indulged in a little daydream, then promptly lay down for a nap in the straw. And thus began Zippy Chippy's storied racing career.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vince Lombardi, one of the greatest NFL coaches of all time, famously said, "Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing." These words have become the battle cry of athletes, coaches, and teams everywhere, but over the years, sports have taken on a literal interpretation of Lombardi's mantra. Match-fixing, doping, sabotage, cocky and mean sportsmanship, all in the name of winning, have infiltrated and scandalized games, teams, reputations, and newspaper headlines. Yet, since his first moments in the world, Zippy Chippy ignored Lombardi and turned his nose at the concept of winning-at-all-costs. In fact, he decided to not win at all, losing, over the course of his career, 100 consecutive races, at some of the greatest tracks in the country: Belmont Park, Aqueduct, Finger Lakes, and Suffolk Downs among them. And he did so with his owner, Felix Monserrate, by his side -- a man who refused to sell Zippy, or even retire him, simply because he couldn't come in first. Soon, Zippy's cheering squad grew to include people who, enchanted by his story, would travel from all over North America to watch him lose but then happily gallop back to his stable. To them, Zippy Chippy was just like them; someone who wasn't an athlete with a million-dollar contract, or someone with movie star looks -- he was a creature who struggled, who lost, and who failed even the lowest of expectations. But, somehow, he found a way to enjoy himself and eagerly return for the next race.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Told with laugh-out-loud wit and a lot of heart, <i>The Legend of Zippy Chippy</i> is the story of the losing-est racehorse in North American history -- a perpetual loser who would become the winning thoroughbred in professional horse racing to steal peoples' hearts.</p></p><p>WILLIAM THOMAS is an author, a scriptwriter and a nationally syndicated humour columnist.

It&#x2019;s an expensive place to live. Smart. Out of your price range. Not the sort of place we usually fetch up. Still two miles away at a rough estimate, and God knows how long that&#x2019;s going to take.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Lights are changing, Kerrigan. I&#x2019;m going to go on straight.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;No, don&#x2019;t do that.&#x201d; Straight ahead of us was a queue of cars that stretched to infinity, or at least the A3. I turned the map around, desperately searching for the right road. &#x201c;Left. Turn left.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m in the wrong lane.&#x201d; The car surged forward, going straight into the one-way system from hell. <br> <br>&#x201c;Should have decided sooner.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why you sound so smug. We&#x2019;re both going to be stuck in the same traffic.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, but it&#x2019;s your fault. So I can enjoy myself by blaming you.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not my fault that you broke your satnav.&#x201d; The ice in my voice did nothing to cool the temperature in the car; I could feel sweat trickling down my back and shifted in my seat. The windows were down but the air was stagnant, hot even though the sun had set hours earlier. August in London, and the weather was at its worst. &#x201c;Since we&#x2019;re stationary, do you mind putting the air conditioning on?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Waste of petrol. Someone&#x2019;s got to think of the environment.&#x201d; He stuck his head out of his window and sniffed enthusiastically. &#x201c;Fresh air is better for you.&#x201d; <br> <br>A hundred exhausts belched fumes in front of us. &#x201c;This air is not fresh.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Nor are my socks,&#x201d; Derwent admitted, sticking a finger down the side of his shoe and proving his point with a waft of sweaty-foot smell. My nose wrinkled and I turned my face away, not caring that he found it funny. <br> <br>&#x201c;Why is there so much traffic at this time of night anyway?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Need you ask? Roadworks. It goes down to one lane from three. We should never have come this way.&#x201d; Derwent inched forward although the car in front hadn&#x2019;t moved. &#x201c;Almost midnight. What were you planning to do this evening?&#x201d; <br> <br>I had hoped for an early night, but I knew better than to say anything that hinted at bed. The DI was as quick to go after innuendo as a terrier barreling down a rat hole. &#x201c;Nothing much. You?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing you want to hear about, I imagine.&#x201d; A sidelong glance. &#x201c;Your loss.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;I doubt that.&#x201d; I knew very little of his private life, but that was precisely as much as I wanted to know about it. I just wished he felt the same way about me. <br> <br>&#x201c;What about your boyfriend?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;What about him?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Is he at home?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s working.&#x201d; <i>And that&#x2019;s all I&#x2019;m saying, so move on.<br><br></i>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re probably pleased to have something to do. Gets you out of the house, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; <br> <br>Thank God. Work talk. &#x201c;It sounds like an interesting case.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;It sounds like a domestic.&#x201d; Derwent rubbed a hand over the back of his neck and looked at it, then wiped it down his trouser leg. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sweating like a pedo in a playground.&#x201d; <br> <br>He was reliably, casually offensive, but every now and then he still managed to shock me. I had decided that he was an acquired taste, and that I could get to like him some day. Today was not that day. <br> <br>&#x201c;Look, if you don&#x2019;t take the next left we&#x2019;re going to be here until midnight.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s one-way.&#x201d; He was leaning forward to see, hugging the steering wheel. I peered in the same direction, seeing the no-entry signs. <br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, bollocks.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;I could blue light it.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Not a good idea,&#x201d; I said automatically. There were strict rules governing when we could travel on blues and twos. Getting to work was not an emergency. <br> <br>Derwent looked at me sideways. His hair was ruffled and he&#x2019;d caught the sun across the bridge of his nose. He looked all of eight years old. &#x201c;Please?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Why are you asking me? You&#x2019;re the senior officer.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right. I am.&#x201d; He sounded pleased at the reminder. &#x201c;Well, off we go. Hit it, Kerrigan.&#x201d; <br> <br>The siren hadn&#x2019;t finished its first whoop before Derwent had pulled out of our line of traffic, making for our illegal turn. We had two wheels on the pavement most of the way. I closed my eyes and muttered, more or less involuntarily, &#x201c;Jesus, Mary and Joseph.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Talk holy to me, Kerrigan. You know I love it when you pray.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Just concentrate on what you&#x2019;re doing, okay?&#x201d; The streets weren&#x2019;t empty enough for rally driving. Because of the weather, people were still out walking their dogs or jogging, in spite of how late it was. They really weren&#x2019;t expecting to be confronted with an unmarked car bearing down on them from the wrong direction, even if we did have our blue lights flashing. <br> <br>We were, however, making progress, and as Derwent pulled out onto the main road&#x2014;causing a bus to slam on its brakes&#x2014;he gave me a wide grin. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s better, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Better than sitting in a traffic jam,&#x201d; I allowed. <br> <br>He shook his head. &#x201c;You just can&#x2019;t say it, can you? &#x2018;I was wrong. You were right, Josh. I should always listen to you.&#x2019;&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. I can&#x2019;t say that. Turn right after these traffic lights.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Up the hill,&#x201d; Derwent checked. <br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s where we&#x2019;re going.&#x201d; <br> <br>Up the hill. Up into the rarefied air of Wimbledon Village, the pretty, exclusive little enclave where expensive boutiques, delis, galleries and caf�s catered to the tastes of the locals and their apparent desire to spend my annual salary on fripperies and cappuccinos. Up to where the houses were detached, set back from the road, and priced in multiple millions. It was leafy and lavish and a different world from where I lived, even though that was only a few miles away as the crow flew. <br> <br>Derwent was paying scant attention to the road, leaning into my personal space. He whistled. &#x201c;Look at that one.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;The house?&#x201d; It was a white-painted mansion with yew lollipops on either side of the front door. <br> <br>&#x201c;The Aston Martin, Kerrigan. I couldn&#x2019;t give a fuck about the house.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Think that&#x2019;s a footballer&#x2019;s gaff?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Could be. Someone with a few hundred grand to spend on one of their cars. I saw it on <i>Top Gear.</i> Beautiful, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; He had slowed to a crawl and was creeping along, hugging the curb as he stared at the car. A BMW overtook us with a blast from its horn and Derwent raised a hand to acknowledge it, hopelessly distracted. <br> <br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;ll call the police if you&#x2019;re not careful. Stop drooling.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;That car or a night with Angelina Jolie. I&#x2019;m not even joking, I wouldn&#x2019;t stop to think about it.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t worry. You&#x2019;re not likely to have to choose any time soon.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Angelina would understand,&#x201d; he said with conviction. &#x201c;She&#x2019;d appreciate it. She&#x2019;d feel the same way.&#x201d; He flicked a look at me. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t get it, do you? It&#x2019;s just a car to you.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a means of getting from A to B. It may not be quite as beautiful, but so is the one that we&#x2019;re sitting in currently. And I would like to get to B before the SOCOs and the boss have packed up and headed home.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Ooh, the boss. Why didn&#x2019;t you say? We&#x2019;d better hurry.&#x201d; Derwent took off with a wheel spin that left six feet of rubber on the road. <br> <br>I ignored the sarcasm and the stunt driving and said nothing else except to direct him through the narrow tree-lined roads until we reached the white wooden barrier that cut off Endsleigh Drive from its neighbors. <br> <br>&#x201c;Cul-de-sac with no vehicular access except for residents. So whoever did it had to walk there.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Unless it was one of the residents.&#x201d; <br> <br>Derwent frowned. &#x201c;Bit extreme for a neighborly dispute.&#x201d; He held his ID out of the window so the policeman guarding the barrier could see who we were. <br> <br>&#x201c;Six houses, all with gates. High hedges.&#x201d; I could only see the roofs of most of the houses. &#x201c;No one will have seen anything. But they might have heard something. This place must be quiet usually.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Not now.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Nope.&#x201d; We drove through the barrier, past the group of spectators hanging around in shorts and T-shirts with the familiar mixture of shock and excitement on their faces. They stared into the car curiously and I stared back, making eye contact with a middle-aged man wearing an expensive watch and a dingy polo shirt, and a younger one whose face was half-hidden by a baseball cap. A couple of seconds and we had gone past them, and the patrol cars with their lights whirling, and the vans for the SOCOs&#x2019; equipment, and the first outriders of the media pack. I&#x2019;d have been shocked if they hadn&#x2019;t been there&#x2014;they made it to most crime scenes long before I did, no matter how quickly I responded, and this was the sort of case that would appeal to them. The very minor thrill of appearing on the television news had long since worn off for me, although it was the one thing that consoled my mother about my career choice. I ran a hand through my hair, despising myself for preening but aware that the heat and humidity had made the usual bad situation worse. I could just hear the message Mum would leave. <i>Did you ever think of brushing your hair before you left the house, Maeve? Surely you&#x2019;d have had time to run a comb through it&nbsp;&#x2026; <br><br></i>Both sides of the road were fully parked up but Derwent refused to drive out again. <br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not far. And you run marathons, so you can&#x2019;t be that lazy.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mind the walk. I mind people not knowing I&#x2019;m a big-shot police inspector.&#x201d; He settled for blocking in a car that I recognized as belonging to the pathologist, Dr. Hanshaw. <br> <br>&#x201c;Glen&#x2019;s not going to be pleased.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Glen is going to be here for a while. And I&#x2019;m not exactly scared of him anyway.&#x201d; Derwent got out and stretched, revealing a damp patch that took up most of the back of his shirt so the material clung to his really quite impressive muscles. I plucked my top away from my skin, knowing that it would be translucent where it had been pressed against me. The heat was like a coat wrapped around me. I pulled a face, then bent down to look for the water bottle I&#x2019;d stashed at my feet. It was too light when I picked it up. Empty, but for a few drops at the bottom. <br> <br>I was still looking at it when Derwent leaned down. &#x201c;Are you getting out or what?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Did you drink my water?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;I had half a bottle of water here. Did you drink it?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;You must be hallucinating, Kerrigan. You finished it yourself.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Bullshit.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Really. I watched you.&#x201d; <br> <br>I knew he was lying but I still hesitated, doubting my memory for a moment. He sounded so sure of himself&#x2014;which was usually a dead giveaway that he wasn&#x2019;t telling the truth. As if to confirm it, his face twisted into a grin, at my expense. <br> <br>&#x201c;Come on. Time to go.&#x201d; <br> <br>There had been a time when I was scared of Derwent, and I still wouldn&#x2019;t argue with him, but not because he intimidated me. He was a senior officer and I would never win. Plus, he liked it too much. I threw the bottle into the back of the car with extreme bad temper and slammed the car door as hard as I could. Derwent led the way up the path, past two PCs who were suffering in their body armor. The stab vests were miserably uncomfortable in the heat, I recalled with sympathy, glad that I only had an equipment belt, and that was slung over my shoulder. It was one of the perks of being in CID. The fact that I didn&#x2019;t usually go out on arrest raids or anything that was expected to be violent meant that I hadn&#x2019;t had to wear body armor for a very long time. It was especially hard on the uniforms when there was almost no chance they would need the vests. Whatever violence had been done at number 4 Endsleigh Drive, the danger had been over for hours. <br> <br>We stopped inside the canvas screens in front of the front door, shedding shoes and pulling on paper suits to avoid contaminating the crime scene. An extra layer was exactly what I didn&#x2019;t need and I wriggled crossly, already stifling. <br> <br>&#x201c;What do we know about the victims?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Mother and daughter. Vita and Laura Kennford. Mum&#x2019;s forty-nine, Laura&#x2019;s fifteen.&#x201d; Derwent recited the details from memory, without hesitation. He was a far better police officer than casual acquaintance with him might have suggested. The bluff misogyny was a large and unfortunate part of his personality, but he was also razor sharp and totally dedicated to his job. <br> <br>&#x201c;And they were stabbed?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;You know as much as I do about that.&#x201d; He looked at me shrewdly. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not trying to spin this out, are you? Trying to find a reason to stay out here until the bodies are gone and the place has been tidied up?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Of course not. Why would I do that?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;Because you don&#x2019;t trust yourself.&#x201d; <br> <br>He wasn&#x2019;t completely wrong, which made it all the more annoying that he&#x2019;d spotted what I was doing. I was getting used to dead bodies&#x2014;I had seen enough of them since I&#x2019;d started working on Godley&#x2019;s team&#x2014;but I still couldn&#x2019;t quite take them in my stride. It wasn&#x2019;t the blood or the spilling intestines, the splattered brain matter or the smell of decay, though all of those things had the potential to turn more experienced officers than me pea-green. It was the violence that made me stop in my tracks. The desire to destroy another human being, the will to carry it through, the ruthlessness or thoughtlessness we encountered every day. The waste. And all we could do was sling the killers in prison, if we caught them. I&#x2019;d never been a fan of the death penalty, but murdered children made me think depriving someone of their liberty was a pretty pathetic punishment. <br> <br>Meanwhile, Derwent was waiting for an answer. I squared my shoulders. &#x201c;I know you like to think of me as a shrinking violet, boss, but I&#x2019;m just not.&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re hard as nails, Kerrigan. We know that.&#x201d; He took my arm and steered me out of the tent and up to the front door. &#x201c;Come on. Feel the fear and do it anyway.&#x201d; <br> <br>Inside the house, I looked past the usual organized chaos of crime-scene technicians and police officers coming and going, searching for signs of what had taken place there. The hall was huge, double-height, with a very modern chandelier suspended in the middle&#x2014;lozenges of textured glass stuck together at haphazard angles. Wide stairs swept up to an open gallery with rooms leading off it, but all the doors were closed. Bedrooms, I presumed, and bathrooms. Nothing to see from where I stood, anyway. There was no furniture in the hall at all, just a set of double doors on either side and a glass door at the back. The only color came from a tapestry that hung on the wall by the stairs, six feet by ten at a guess, and fiercely abstract in tones of gray and orange. <br> <br>It was the only color, that is, apart from the red tracks that marked the cream carpet. Blood, still harshly bright in the glare from the chandelier, not yet darkened to brown. Fresh. There was a story there, a narrative that some specialist would unravel, but I couldn&#x2019;t help trying to fathom it. Footsteps coming from the right-hand side of the hall, fading as they got closer to the door at the back, spreading and blurring where water had mingled with blood. Coming back toward the front door, much fainter now. And then a set of smudges on the stairs, where someone or some people had run up two or three at a time, moving fast. A forensics officer was crouching five steps ...</p><h2>Disrupt-Her: A Manifesto for the Modern Woman</h2><p><b>From the co-founder of THINX and hellotushy.com, start-ups collectively valued at more than $150 million, comes DISRUPT-HER, a rallying cry for women to radically question the status quo.<br></b><br>Miki Agrawal has faced patriarchal pushback, fought girl-on-girl hate, ridden the roller coaster of building businesses as a female CEO, and even overcome an attempt to burn her for witchcraft (figuratively).<br><br>In order to navigate the complicated--at times maddening--struggles of contemporary femininity, we need an unabashed manifesto for the modern woman that inspires us to move past outrage and take positive steps on the personal, professional, and societal levels.<br><br>This manifesto galvanizes us to action in 13 major areas of our lives with as much fire power as possible.

After years of desperately wanting a baby, Sophie has just given birth to a stillborn child, and she is struggling to overcome her devastation. Meanwhile, Olivia wrestles with her own secrets about the cruel and violent man she married many years before. Exquisitely written and reminiscent of Ian McEwan and J. M.

In keeping with his reputation for writing about big ideas in an illuminating and graceful way, he shows how sports respond to deep human needs; describes the ways in which baseball, football and basketball became national institutions and how they reached their present forms; and covers the evolution of rules, the rise and fall of the most successful teams, and the historical significance of the most famous and influential figures such as Babe Ruth, Vince Lombardi, and Michael Jordan.<br><br> Whether he is writing about baseball as the agrarian game, football as similar to warfare, basketball as the embodiment of post-industrial society, or the moral havoc created by baseball's designated hitter rule, Mandelbaum applies the full force of his learning and wit to subjects about which so many Americans care passionately: the games they played in their youth and continue to follow as adults. By offering a fresh and unconventional perspective on these games, <i>The Meaning of Sports</i> makes for fascinating and rewarding reading both for fans and newcomers.</p><p><b>Michael Mandelbaum</b> is one of the nation's leading authorities on American foreign policy and international relations and the author or co-author of eight books, including <i>The Ideas That Conquered The World: Peace, Democracy, and Free Markets in the Twenty-First Century</i>.Of all the sporting contests in the world, baseball, basketball and football are by far the most popular in America: millions of diehard fans dedicate countless hours to following these games on TV, in print and in person. But perhaps few fans know why they are drawn to one sport more than another, or why they feel such a strong affiliation to their favorite. In his ninth book, Mandelbaum applies the same tactical research skills that made him a leading authority on American foreign policy to chronicling the history of the big-three American sports, of the superstars who became household names and of the evolution of the rules of each game. Baseball, which experienced its great rise during America&#x2019;s agrarian stage when the majority of the nation&#x2019;s people lived in rural areas, plays to our longing for the pure, the outdoors, he says. When the country entered its industrial period, and many people worked in factories with extremely specialized jobs, football, a sport in which each player is assigned carefully specialized roles, began to evolve in American schools. Basketball, unlike the other more organic sports, was invented during the post-industrial age. Like the "knowledge workers" of that era-the economists, psychologists and designers-basketball required that athletes bring little equipment to the court. The author parallels each sport&#x2019;s history with the history of our nation, explaining in textbook-like prose why each became popular and endured where other sports did not.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The book has been compiled with complete access to the family archives, and with the full cooperation of Toth's children. To flesh out the complete story of his life and art, Mullaney and Canwell have spent more than two years conducting wide-ranging interviews with Toth's peers, friends, and family members. This is the beginning of a comics biography everyone will be talking about for years to come.<br> <br> In addition to art and photographs from the family, Toth fans and friends throughout the world have loaned original artwork reproduced in the entire series. Included are many examples of Toth's art, from twenty-one complete stories to rare pages, as well as&#x2014;incredibly&#x2014;a previously unknown, unfinished, and unpublished penciled story from the 1950s! The tome covers his earliest stories at DC in the 1940s, his defining work at Standard, his incomparable <i>Zorro</i> comics in the 1950s, and a special section collects&#x2014;for the first time&#x2014;the <i>Jon Fury</i> pages that Toth produced while in the army, a section that alone is worth the price of admission.<br> <br> <i>Genius, Isolated</i> details Toth's life story and work through the early 1960s, when he began his sensational move into animated cartoons. The second book in the series, <i>Genius, Illustrated</i>, continues the story.<br> <br> <br><br></p><p>Born in New York City in 1928, Alex Toth attended what is now the School of Visual Arts and broke into the comic book field as a teenager. During his sixty-year professional career, he became known as the "artists' artist"&#x2014;he became very much like his great hero, Noel Sickles&#x2014;the guy all the others wanted to draw like. In the 1960s he entered the animation field and became equally well-known and respected for his groundbreaking designs for Space Ghost and The Herculoids, among other series."What Mullaney and Canwell have done here is nothing short of wonderful. They've presented a well chosen selection of the first full decade of Toth's career, arguably his most creative period, in a beautifully designed volume that conveys the artist's evolution - an astonishingly brief transition that happened in barely five years - from talented beginner to absolute master." &#x2014;Howard Chaykin, <i>The Los Angeles Review of Books</i></p><h2>The Graywolf Annual Five: Multi-Cultural Literacy</h2><p><p>The issue of cultural literacy has been the subject of intense debate in the past two years.

Sadly, these things characterize many Christian homes as well; but God meant for the Christian marriage to be a tranquil partnership, producing a true haven from the world&#39;s pressures. Such good Christian marriages are not just lucky coincidences, nor are they easily produced. There are no shortcuts; but God&#39;s principles, surprisingly few and simple, are clear scriptural patterns that any child of God can follow. If practiced patiently and consistently, they work! &#34;Have a Heavenly Marriage&#34; explains these principles with memorable illustrations and numerous case scenarios. It is easy, gripping reading that focuses on the true causes, not just the symptoms, of sour relationships. David Sorenson is an experienced pastor and is author of several popular books. He and his wife, Pam, have themselves experienced a heavenly marriage built on the concepts presented in these pages.</p><p></p><h2>Discourse on Metaphysics and the Monadology (Great Books in Philosophy)</h2><p>Leibniz (1646 - 1716) was a true polymath and has been called the most comprehensive thinker since Aristotle. In these two great works by the founder of modern German speculative philosophy, the reader is introduced to Leibniz&#39;s metaphysics, including his conception of physical substance, the motion and resistance of bodies, and the role of the divine within the dynamic universe.</p><p><b>GOTTFRIED WILHELM LEIBNIZ</b> was born in Leipzig, Germany, on July 1, 1646. Showing signs of a prodigious intellect even at an early age, Leibniz entered the University of Leipzig at fifteen to study law, mathematics, and phi�losophy. Since Leipzig refused to grant him a doctoral degree because of his youth, Leibniz transferred to the University at Altdorf, near Nuremberg, where he received his doctorate in 1666, before his twenty-first birthday.<br><br> Shortly thereafter, Leibniz entered the civil service, first with the Elector of Mainz and later with the ducal family of Braunschweig-Lueneburg. Leibniz's diplomatic missions took him to Paris, London, Amsterdam, and finally, Hanover, where he made his home. Opportunities for travel brought Leibniz into contact with the leading luminaries of the day, including the philosophers Nicolas de Malebranche and Baruch de Spinoza, and the mathematician Christiaan Huygens. A true polymath, Leibniz wrote ex�tensively on legal, cultural, and political affairs; compiled an official history of the Braunschweig family; and made seminal contributions to mathematics, theology, and phi�losophy. In his two great philosophical works, the <i>Discourse on Metaphysics </i>and the <i>Monadology, </i>Leibniz outlined his metaphysical system, including his conception of physical substance, the motion and resistance of bodies, and the role of the divine within the dynamic universe.<br><br> For his diplomatic and scholarly achievements, Leibniz was honored by being made a member of the Academy of Sciences in Paris, president of the Berlin Academy, privy councillor to royalty, and a baronet of the empire. Yet Leibniz's last years were dogged by illness and increasing&nbsp;neglect by those who regarded him as heterodox in religion. He died in Hanover on November 14, 1716.<br><br> Leibniz's other works include a code of international law; <i>Systema theologicum </i>(1687); and <i>Essais de theodicee </i>(1710), his most important work in theology.</p><h2>First Time in Forever (Puffin Island, 1)</h2><p>Windswept, isolated and ruggedly beautiful, Puffin Island is a haven for day-trippers and daydreamers alike.

A dream destination for people who loved the sea.<br><br>Emily Donovan hated the sea.<br><br>She stopped the car at the top of the hill and turned off the headlights. Darkness wrapped itself around her, smothering her like a heavy blanket. She was used to the city, with its shimmering skyline and the dazzle of lights that turned night into day. Here, on this craggy island in coastal Maine, there was only the moon and the stars. No crowds, no car horns, no high-rise buildings. Nothing but wave-pounded cliffs, the shriek of gulls and the smell of the ocean.<br><br>She would have drugged herself on the short ferry crossing if it hadn't been for the child strapped into the seat in the back of the car.<br><br>The little girl's eyes were still closed, her head tilted to one side and her arms locked in a stranglehold around a battered teddy bear. Emily retrieved her phone and opened the car door quietly.<br><br><em>Please don't wake up.</em><br><br>She walked a few steps away from the car and dialed. The call went to voice mail.<br><br>"Brittany? Hope you're having a good time in Greece. Just wanted to let you know I've arrived. Thanks again for letting me use the cottage. I'm really...<br><br>I'm&#x2014;" <em>Grateful.</em> That was the word she was looking for. Grateful. She took a deep breath and closed her eyes. "I'm panicking. What the hell am I doing here? There's water everywhere and I hate water. This is&#x2014; Well, it's hard." She glanced toward the sleeping child and lowered her voice. "She wanted to get out of the car on the ferry, but I kept her strapped in because there was <em>no way</em> I was doing that. That scary harbor guy with the big eyebrows probably thinks I'm insane, by the way, so you'd better pretend you don't know me next time you're home. I'll stay until tomorrow because there's no choice, but then I'm taking the first ferry out of here. I'm going somewhere else. Somewhere landlocked like...like...Wyoming or Nebraska."<br><br>As she ended the call the breeze lifted her hair, and she could smell salt and sea in the air.<br><br>She dialed again, a different number this time, and felt a rush of relief as the call was answered and she heard Skylar's breathy voice.<br><br>"Skylar Tempest."<br><br>"Sky? It's me."<br><br>"Em? What's happening? This isn't your number."<br><br>"I changed my cell phone."<br><br>"You're worried someone might trace the call? Holy crap, this is exciting."<br><br>"It's not exciting. It's a nightmare."<br><br>"How are you feeling?"<br><br>"Like I want to throw up, but I know I won't because I haven't eaten for two days. The only thing in my stomach is a knot of nervous tension."<br><br>"Have the press tracked you down?"<br><br>"I don't think so. I paid cash for everything and drove from New York." She glanced back at the road, but there was only darkness. "How do people live like this? I feel like a criminal. I've never hidden from anyone in my life before."<br><br>"Have you been switching cars to confuse them? Did you dye your hair purple and buy a pair of glasses?"<br><br>"No. Have you been drinking?"<br><br>"I watch a lot of movies. You can't trust anyone. You need a disguise. Something that will help you blend in."<br><br>"I will never blend in anywhere with a coastline. I'll be the one wearing a life jacket in the middle of Main Street."<br><br>"You're going to be fine." Skylar's extrafirm tone suggested she wasn't at all convinced by what she was saying.<br><br>"I'm leaving first thing tomorrow."<br><br>"You can't do that! We agreed the cottage would be the safest place to hide. No one is going to notice you on an island crowded with tourists. It's a dream place for a vacation."<br><br>"It's not a dream place when the sight of water makes you hyperventilate."<br><br>"You're not going to do that. You're going to breathe in the sea air and relax."<br><br>"I don't need to be here. This whole thing is an over-reaction. No one is looking for me."<br><br>"You're the half sister of one of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood, and you're guardian to her child. If that little fact gets out, the whole press pack will be hunting you. You need somewhere to hide, and Puffin Island is perfect."<br><br>Emily shivered under a cold drench of panic. "Why would they know about me? Lana spent her entire life pretending I don't exist." And that had suited her perfectly. At no point had she aspired to be caught in the beam of Lana's spotlight. Emily was fiercely private.<br><br>Lana, on the other hand, had demanded attention from the day she was born.<br><br>It occurred to Emily that her half sister would have enjoyed the fact she was still making headlines even though it had been over a month since the plane crash that had killed her and the man reputed to have been her lover.<br><br>"Journalists can find out anything. This is like a plot for a movie."<br><br>"No, it isn't! It's my <em>life.</em> I don't want it ripped open and exposed for the world to see and I don't&#x2014;" Emily broke off and then said the words aloud for the first time. "I don't want to be responsible for a child." Memories from the past drifted from the dark corners of her brain like smoke under a closed door. "I can't be."<br><br>It wasn't fair to the girl.<br><br>And it wasn't fair to her.<br><br>Why had Lana done this to her? Was it malice? Lack of thought? Some twisted desire to seek revenge for a childhood where they'd shared nothing except living space?<br><br>"I know you think that, and I understand your reasons, but you can do this. You have to. Right now you're all she has."<br><br>"I shouldn't be all anyone has. That's a raw deal. I shouldn't be looking after a child for five minutes, let alone the whole summer."<br><br>No matter that in her old life people deferred to her, recognized her expertise and valued her judgment; in this she was incompetent. She had no qualifications that equipped her for this role. Her childhood had been about surviving. About learning to nurture herself and protect herself while she lived with a mother who was mostly absent&#x2014;sometimes physically, always emotionally. And after she'd left home, her life had been about studying and working long, punishing hours to silence men determined to prove she was less than they were.<br><br>And now here she was, thrown into a life where what she'd learned counted for nothing. A life that required the one set of skills she <em>knew</em> she didn't possess. She didn't know how to be this. She didn't know how to <em>do</em> this. And she'd never had ambitions to do it. It felt like an injustice to find herself in a situation she'd worked hard to avoid all her life.<br><br>Beads of sweat formed on her forehead, and she heard Skylar's voice through a mist of anxiety.<br><br>"If having her stops you thinking that, this will turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you. You weren't to blame for what happened when you were a child, Em."<br><br>"I don't want to talk about it."<br><br>"Doesn't change the fact you weren't to blame. And you don't need to talk about it because the way you feel is evident in the way you've chosen to live your life."<br><br>Emily glanced back at the child sleeping in the car. "I can't take care of her. I can't be what she needs."<br><br>"You mean you don't want to be."<br><br>"My life is adult-focused. I work sixteen-hour days and have business lunches."<br><br>"Your life sucks. I've been telling you that for a long time."<br><br>"I liked my life! I want it back."<br><br>"That was the life where you were working like a machine and living with a man with the emotional compass of a rock?"<br><br>"I liked my job. I knew what I was doing. I was competent. And Neil and I may not have had a grand passion, but we shared a lot of interests."<br><br>"Name one."<br><br>"I&#x2014; We liked eating out."<br><br>"That's not an interest. That's an indication that you were both too tired to cook."<br><br>"We both enjoyed reading."<br><br>"Wow, that must have made the bedroom an exciting place."<br><br>Emily struggled to come up with something else and failed. "Why are we talking about Neil? That's over. My whole life now revolves around a six-year-old girl. There is a pair of fairy wings in her bag. I don't know anything about fairy wings."<br><br>Her childhood had been a barren desert, an exercise in endurance rather than growth, with no room for anything as fragile and destructible as gossamer-thin fairy wings.<br><br>"I have a vivid memory of being six. I wanted to be a ballerina."<br><br>Emily stared straight ahead, remembering how she'd felt at the age of six. Broken. Even after she'd eventually stuck herself back together, she'd known she wasn't the same.<br><br>"I'm mad at Lana. I'm mad at her for dying and for putting me in this position. How screwed up is that?"<br><br>"It's not screwed up. It's human. What do you expect, Em? You haven't spoken to Lana in over a decade&#x2014;" Skylar broke off, and Emily heard voices in the background.<br><br>"Do you have company? Did I catch you at a bad time?"<br><br>"Richard and I are off to a fund-raiser at The Plaza, but he can wait."<br><br>From what she knew of Richard's ruthless political ambitions and impatient nature, Emily doubted he'd be prepared to wait. She could imagine Skylar, her blond hair secured in an elegant twist on top of her head, her narrow body sheathed in a breathtaking designer creation. She suspected Richard's attraction to Sky lay in her family's powerful connections rather than her sunny optimism or her beauty. "I shouldn't have called you. I tried Brittany, but she's not answering. She's still on that archaeological dig in Crete. I guess it's the middle of the night over there."<br><br>"She seems to be having a good time. Did you see her Facebook update? She's up to her elbows in dirt and hot Greek men. She's working with that lovely ceramics expert, Lily, who gave me all those ideas for my latest collection. And if you hadn't called me I would have called you. I've been so worried. First Neil dumped you, then you had to leave your job, and now this! They say trouble comes in threes."<br><br>Emily eyed the child, still sleeping in the car. "I wish the third thing had been a broken toaster."<br><br>"You're going through a bad time, but you have to remember that everything happens for a reason. For a start, it has stopped you wallowing in bed eating cereal from the box. You needed a focus and now you have one."<br><br>"I didn't need a dependent six-year-old who dresses in pink and wears fairy wings."<br><br>"Wait a minute&#x2014;" There was a pause and then the sound of a door clicking. "Richard is talking to his campaign manager, and I don't want them listening. I'm hiding in the bathroom. The things I do in the name of friendship. You still there, Em?"<br><br>"Where would I go? I'm surrounded by water." She shuddered. "I'm trapped."<br><br>"Honey, people pay good money to be 'trapped' on Puffin Island."<br><br>"I'm not one of them. What if I can't keep her safe, Sky?"<br><br>There was a brief silence. "Are we talking about safe from the press or safe from other stuff?"<br><br>Her mouth felt dry. "All of it. I don't want the responsibility. I don't want children."<br><br>"Because you're afraid to give anything of yourself."<br><br>There was no point in arguing with the truth.<br><br>"That's why Neil ended it. He said he was tired of living with a robot."<br><br>"I guess he used his own antennae to work that out. Bastard. Are you brokenhearted?"<br><br>"No. I'm not as emotional as you and Brittany. I don't feel deeply." But she should feel <em>something,</em> shouldn't she? The truth was that after two years of living with a man, she'd felt no closer to him than she had the day she'd moved in. Love wrecked people, and she didn't want to be wrecked. And now she had a child. "Why do you think Lana did it?"<br><br>"Made you guardian? God knows. But knowing Lana, it was because there wasn't anyone else. She'd pissed off half of Hollywood and slept with the other half, so I guess she didn't have any friends who would help. Just you."<br><br>"But she and I&#x2014;"<br><br>"I know. Look, if you want my honest opinion, it was probably because she knew you would put your life on hold and do the best for her child despite the way she treated you. Whatever you think about yourself, you have a deep sense of responsibility. She took advantage of the fact you're a good, decent person. Em, I am <em>so</em> sorry, but I have to go. The car is outside and Richard is pacing. Patience isn't one of his good qualities and he has to watch his blood pressure."<br><br>"Of course." Privately Emily thought if Richard worked harder at controlling his temper, his blood pressure might follow, but she didn't say anything. She wasn't in a position to give relationship advice to anyone. "Thanks for listening. Have fun tonight."<br><br>"I'll call you later. No, wait&#x2014;I have a better idea. Richard is busy this weekend, and I was going to escape to my studio, but why don't I come to you instead?"<br><br>"Here? To Puffin Island?"<br><br>"Why not? We can have some serious girl time. Hang out in our pajamas and watch movies like we did when Kathleen was alive. We can talk through everything and make a plan. I'll bring everything I can find that is pink. Get through to the weekend. Take this a day at a time."<br><br>"I am not qualified to take care of a child for five minutes, let alone five days." But the thought of getting back on that ferry in the morning made her feel almost as sick as the thought of being responsible for another human being.<br><br>"Listen to me." Skylar lowered her voice. "I feel bad speaking ill of the dead, but you know a lot more than Lana did. She left the kid alone in a house the size of France and hardly ever saw her. Just be there. Seeing the same person for two consecutive days will be a novelty. How is she, anyway? Does she understand what has happened? Is she traumatized?"<br><br>Emily thought about the child, silent and solemn-eyed. Trauma, she knew, wore different faces. "She's quiet. Scared of anyone with a camera."<br><br>"Probably overwhelmed by the crowds of paparazzi outside the house."<br><br>"The psychologist said the most important thing is to show her she's secure."<br><br>"You need to cut off her hair and change her name or something. A six-year-old girl with long blond hair called Juliet is a giveaway. You might as well hang a sign on her saying 'Made in Hollywood'"<br><br>"You think so?" Panic sank sharp claws into her flesh. "I thought coming out here to the middle of nowhere would be enough. The name isn't that unusual."<br><br>"Maybe not in isolation, but attached to a six-year-old everyone is talking about? Trust me, you need to change it. Puffin Island may be remote geographically, but it has the internet. Now go and hide out and I'll see you Friday night. Do you still have your key to the cottage?"<br><br>"Yes." She'd felt the weight of it in her pocket all the way from New York. Brittany had presented them both with a key on their last day of college. "And thanks."<br><br>"Hey." Sky's voice softened. "We made a promise, remember? We are always here for each other. Speak to you later!"<br><br>In the moment before she hung up, Emily heard a hard male voice in the background and wondered again what free-spirited Skylar saw in Richard Everson.<br><br>As she slid back into the car the child stirred. "Are we there yet?"<br><br></p><h2>Braids &amp; Bows: Easy Step-By-Step Instructions (The Creative Activity Kit)</h2><p>1997 slight wear on corners.</p><p></p><h2>Man Meets Dog</h2><p>In this wonderful book, the famous scientist and best-selling author, Konrad Lorenz, 'the man who talked with animals', enlightens and entertains us with his illustrated account of the unique relationship between humans and their pets.

Grades 9-12. --Francisca Goldsmith</p><h2>Recovering the Past: A Historian&#39;s Memoir</h2><p>Forrest McDonald is a legend in his own time. The NEH's sixteenth Jefferson Lecturer, he is one of our most eminent historians and the author of numerous provocative works on the early American republic, the Constitution, and the American presidency. Renowned for his sly wit and iconoclasm, he is also a conservative in a mostly liberal profession, a man who believes that his discipline has been subverted by those who serve public policy agendas. He now candidly recounts and reconsiders his own career, mixing in equal measure autobiography with a sharp critique of the historical craft.<br><br>Beginning in 1949, McDonald has traversed a sometimes rocky academic road from Brown University to Wayne State and finally the University of Alabama. He rose to prominence by arguing against the popular histories of Frederick Jackson Turner and Charles Beard, and his rebuttal of the latter was published as his seminal book We the People. <i>Recovering the Past</i> carries forward this critical tradition with McDonald's pointed comments on fellow historians from Kenneth Stampp to William Appleton Williams, his admiration for Oscar Handlin's book <i>Truth in History</i>, and his distaste for the revisionism of the New Left historians who depict the American story as an epic of oppression.<br><br>"The norm is to write for one's fellow historians," he says, "but that seems to me to be wrong-headed and to result in stultifying reading. I have chosen, instead, to write for that elusive critter called the general reader, or, more precisely, for the vast number of people who genuinely love history for its own sake&#x2014;which, as will become evident, I regard as eliminating a sizable majority of professional historians."<br><br>As McDonald observes, thinking historically facilitates our knowing who and where we are, and the reward of studying the past comes when one realizes how its many parts fit together. As the pieces of his own past fall together, they form a story that will engross, inform, and even gall readers seeking an inside look behind the ivied walls of academe. <i>Recovering the Past</i> offers an eye-opening look at one man and his discipline; more than that, it is a manifesto for those who truly care about history.</p><p>This book is as engaging as it is provocative. McDonald's autobiographical one-man tour through the major battles of twentieth-century American historiography is hard to put down.--Pauline Maier, author of <i>American Scripture</i> <p>When a first-rate historian reflects on his life and work with candor and wisdom, other historians will want to read it. But McDonald has written a book that anyone who cares about education, or is just in the mood for a witty romp through the vicissitudes of academia, will enjoy and profit from.--Eugene D. Genovese, author of <i>The Southern Tradition</i> </p><p>A delightful and informative account that captures the sense of intellectual adventure that drew McDonald to the life of a historian, as well as his thoughtful reactions to the controversies that have plagued the profession in recent years.--Diane Ravitch, author of <i>The Language Police</i></p>Forrest McDonald is Distinguished University Research Professor emeritus at the University of Alabama.</p><h2>To Tame a Dangerous Lord (The Courtship Wars)</h2><p><b><i>Seduction takes a delightful, daring twist as Nicole Jordan&#x2019;s irresistibly sensual Courtship Wars series continues.<br></i></b><br>&nbsp;<br>Dangerously sexy nobleman and former spymaster Rayne Kenyon, Earl of Haviland, has no interest in love. He merely desires an heir to carry on his title and therefore must have a wife. Rayne makes a surprising choice of brides by settling on the plain spinster daughter of a fellow spy who once saved his life. But the spirited and witty Madeline Ellis proves much more than Rayne bargained for.<br><br>Dazed by Rayne&#x2019;s smoldering kisses, Madeline knows that she&#x2019;s at last found love&#x2014;with a man determined to avoid it. Once wedded, she decides to take fate into her own hands. Maybe, just maybe, she can kindle the fires in Rayne&#x2019;s heart by turning her plain, ordinary self into a dazzling temptress. With a little help from the Loring sisters, the earl&#x2019;s artless new wife becomes a beautiful, bold seductress in their marriage bed. But who could imagine that a simple marriage of convenience can suddenly be flooded with danger, desire, and unexpected love?<br>&nbsp;<br>"One of my all time favorite writers, Nicole Jordan delivers romance like no one else. Captivating, enticing, and irresistible, her books are always on my must buy list."&#x2014;<i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Sherrilyn Kenyon<br></p><p>Nicole Jordan is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of numerous historical romances. She lives with her real-life hero (her husband) in the Rocky Mountains of Utah, where she is at work on her next enthralling tale about the sparks that fly when Regency lovers play the matrimonial mating game.<i>Chapter One<br><br></i><br>I wish you were still here to counsel me, Maman. You never warned me that a man&#x2019;s kiss could be so thrilling, or that a simple embrace could shatter a woman&#x2019;s senses. It was a most startling revelation!<br><br>Near London; September 1817<br><br>&#x201c;Of all the dratted ill luck,&#x201d; Madeline Ellis muttered as she peered out the inn&#x2019;s bedchamber window at the dimly-lit stableyard below. &#x201c;First the stage and now Lord Ackerby.&#x201d;<br><br>Her heart sank at her worsening predicament. It was vexing enough that the stagecoach carrying her to London had lost a wheel in the middle of a torrential rainstorm this afternoon, stranding her an hour short of her destination, which meant depleting her meager funds on a night&#x2019;s lodging at a posting inn. But now the lecherous Baron Ackerby had somehow found her trail.<br><br>Madeline had just retired for bed when she was alerted by the commotion of the baron&#x2019;s traveling chaise arriving in the cobbled yard of The Drake. She could see his lordship&#x2019;s elegantly-garbed figure below in the lamplight, could hear his imperious voice giving orders to change his team while he inquired inside.<br><br>When his gaze swept upward, Madeline ducked behind the window curtain to avoid being seen.<br><br>&#x201c;This is beyond maddening,&#x201d; she said through gritted teeth.<br><br>For years Lord Ackerby had merely hinted at his desire to have her for his mistress, but recently his unwanted advances had become disgustingly overt, and eluding him was proving an exercise in futility.<br><br>Madeline winced at the thought of the persistent libertine finding her here. She couldn&#x2019;t believe Ackerby was actually licentious enough to try to ravish her to force her compliance, but even so, she was far too vulnerable in her nightdress and bare feet. Regrettably, though, she had no dressing gown with her, since her trunk was still strapped to the back of the stagecoach. And her cloak was clammy and damp from traipsing down the road in a pouring rain after the wheel mishap. She likely had no time, either, to pull on her muddy half boots. Doubtless the baron would inquire of the innkeep if a lady of her description&#x2014;medium brown hair, average height, drab attire&#x2014;had passed this way today. And he would be directed to her bedchamber upstairs, where the flimsy door latch would provide scant deterrence. Heaven forbid.<br><br>In determination Madeline squared her shoulders. With her employer&#x2019;s recent demise and her brother&#x2019;s untimely departure, she had no one to depend on but herself. So you might as well take action instead of standing here frozen like a halfwit, she scolded herself. Besides, she was a soldier&#x2019;s daughter who had learned to be strong and self-sufficient.<br><br>&#x201c;He thinks me defenseless, Maman, but he will discover differently,&#x201d; Madeline added as she searched her reticule in the darkness.<br><br>She had the admittedly eccentric habit of talking to her late French mother, seeking her unspoken counsel. Jacqueline Ellis was long in her grave, much to the grief of her husband and two children, having been carried off by a deadly ague the winter when Madeline was thirteen. It had been the saddest day of her life. But carrying on imaginary conversations with her dear departed mother made her feel as if Maman were still with her.<br><br>To Madeline&#x2019;s further sorrow, her father had been killed in the war five years later. And her only remaining family&#x2014;her younger brother Gerard&#x2014;had left the district this week, having secretly eloped to Scotland with his childhood sweetheart.<br><br>Madeline felt a trifle better when she located her small, single-shot pistol in her reticule. Yet she didn&#x2019;t relish waiting here like a helpless mouse being hunted by a bird of prey.<br><br>&#x201c;And soldier&#x2019;s daughter or not, there is no shame in retreating when the odds are against you,&#x201d; Madeline reminded herself. Papa would have said it wasn&#x2019;t cowardly to flee under such circumstance, merely wise.<br><br>After checking that the pistol was primed and loaded, she opened her bedchamber door and peered out. The corridor was empty, she saw in the dim light of a wall sconce.<br><br>Slipping from her room, she shut the door quietly and crept down the hall, heading toward the rear of the inn. She could hear laughter and raucous masculine camaraderie from the taproom below as she rounded the corner searching for a place to hide.<br><br>To her relief, she saw an open door to what was obviously a parlor rather than a bedchamber. A welcoming fire crackled in the grate, while a low-burning lamp illuminated the near side of the room.<br><br>Hearing an ominous tread of footsteps on the staircase behind her, Madeline slipped inside the parlor and took up a defensive position behind the door.<br><br>Dismayingly, Baron Ackerby&#x2019;s persistence had only been emboldened three weeks ago when her longtime position as a lady&#x2019;s companion ended with the passing of her elderly employer, a crabby but dear noblewoman. At the moment Madeline was heading to London to seek work at an employment agency, since it was even more imperative now that she find the means to support herself. In championing the course of true love, she&#x2019;d helped her brother elope to Scotland and had given him all her remaining savings.<br><br>Madeline loathed being in such a vulnerable situation, virtually penniless and at the mercy of a powerful, wealthy lord who thought he ruled everything and everyone in proximity to Chelmsford, Essex. She was convinced that Baron Ackerby wanted her chiefly because she had always resisted him. Why else would he pursue a spinster of somewhat plain looks and outspoken wit if not for the challenge of vanquishing her?<br><br>Apparently, her stubborn defiance only roused his determination to have her for his mistress. Even so, Madeline could scarcely believe Ackerby&#x2019;s gall when he&#x2019;d voiced his humiliating proposition outright not two hours after her employer was laid in her grave!<br><br>Madeline&#x2019;s bloodlines, too, were a strike against her. The French �migr�s in their community were generally poor and had little defense against the whims of the nobility and gentry. Madeline was only half French&#x2014;her father had been a captain in the British Army and a brilliant intelligence officer serving under General Lord Wellington&#x2014;but even so, she had little protection now against a lascivious nobleman bent on owning her.<br><br>Standing there in the parlor, barefoot and scantily dressed, Madeline shivered. Perhaps she should have wrapped a bed quilt around her to stave off the chill. Even holding her pistol at the ready, she felt vulnerable. She despised this feeling of powerlessness. She could feel her heart beating much too rapidly as she wondered what excuse the baron would have given to the innkeep for following her&#x2014;<br><br>Just then the hair on the back of her neck stood up. Evidently she was mistaken about the parlor being empty, for she sensed a threatening presence behind her.<br><br>Her heart practically stopped when a man&#x2019;s strong fingers suddenly closed around her wrist like a manacle. Gasping, Madeline whirled to face him, but the next instant he claimed her pistol and hauled her against him. She was jolted by the impact as arms of steel clamped around her body, holding her immobile.<br><br>Stunned, she gazed up at her raven-haired captor. He was tall, powerfully built, with a sense of danger about him that was unmistakable. But it was his physical masculine beauty that took her breath away: Strong, chiseled features, winged black brows, and dark fringed blue eyes.<br><br>Eyes that were pinning her with a deadly look at the moment.<br><br>Dear heavens, Maman . . . what have I done? Madeline wondered before silently answering her own question.<br><br>Evidently she had jumped from the proverbial frying pan into the fire.<br><br>She swallowed hard, wondering if it would benefit her to scream.<br><br>Rayne Kenyon, Earl of Haviland, had seen a good deal in his illustrious career with British Intelligence, but it was not every day he encountered a woman garbed only in a nightdress brandishing a pistol.<br><br>And to think he was just lamenting again how dull his life had been of late, Rayne reflected as he tightened his hold on the intruder.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t take kindly to the threat of weapons when he was unarmed himself. Besides, the last female to brandish a pistol at him had been a French spy out for his blood. Therefore, when this scantily dressed interloper had barged into the private parlor where he was awaiting the arrival of a relative, his survival instincts had taken over, along with his highly trained reflexes.<br><br>But now that he&#x2019;d disarmed her, a different set of impulses swiftly gained control. His senses registered the lush warmth of her body, the sweet scent of her skin, the luminous shock in her wide gray eyes.<br><br>Bloody hell, Rayne thought wryly, clamping down on his urges. It was damned foolish to be lusting after a strange female who might be bent on assassination. Although it was unlikely anyone wanted to kill him just now. His days as a spymaster were long over.<br><br>And she looked startled enough that he doubted his assassination was her chief aim.<br><br>&#x201c;I b-beg your pardon,&#x201d; she stammered, her voice shaken and breathless. &#x201c;I d-didn&#x2019;t realize this parlor was occupied.&#x201d;<br><br>He relaxed his hold a measure, although he kept one arm around her waist while he examined her pistol.<br><br>When he saw her eyeing the weapon longingly, Rayne shook his head and lowered the pistol to his side. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll keep this, if you please.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I would not have used it on you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then why were you carrying it?&#x201d;<br><br>She went rigid upon hearing footsteps out in the corridor. &#x201c;Please,&#x201d; she whispered urgently, peering over her shoulder toward the door. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t give me away.&#x201d;<br><br>She was clearly concerned about whomever was out in the corridor.<br><br>&#x201c;I hope you will forgive me,&#x201d; she added suddenly, turning back to him, &#x201c;if I ask you to kiss me.&#x201d; Then wrapping her arms around his neck, she lifted her face and plastered her mouth to his.<br><br>In his dozen years working for the Crown, Rayne had rarely been caught so off guard. But the press of her full lips against his was an utter surprise, one that sent a jolt of pure pleasure rocketing through him.<br><br>Her mouth was ripe and warm, as was her body, so once more he reacted on sheer instinct: He returned her kiss with an involuntary hunger.<br><br>Her taste was keenly arousing and unexpectedly sweet. Without thought, Rayne increased the pleasure by parting her lips with his thrusting tongue.<br><br>At first she stiffened in response, as if startled herself by the novelty of his action. Yet she opened to his exploration, perhaps because she was too stunned to do otherwise.<br><br>He might have gone on kissing her for some time if not for the gruff male voice intruding on the intimate moment.<br><br>&#x201c;What the devil is the meaning of this!&#x201d;<br><br>To Rayne&#x2019;s regret, the woman in his arms gave a jerk and pulled her mouth away. She was flushed and trembling when she turned to face the newcomer, but under the circumstances her poise was admirable when she said coolly, &#x201c;Lord Ackerby, what brings you here?&#x201d;<br><br>She obviously knew the tall, auburn-haired gentleman who was pinning her with an intense stare.<br><br>&#x201c;Why, you, of course, Madeline. I heard that you had left Chelmsford to look for employment, so I thought to convey you to London myself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That is kind of you, my lord, but I have no need of your assistance.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Certainly you do. You currently have no income, and no means of transportation.&#x201d;<br><br>Her chin raised at a slight angle of defiance. &#x201c;I can manage on my own. And as you see, I am busy at the moment. I should think even you would realize it is ragmannered to interrupt a tryst.&#x201d;<br><br>The nobleman looked taken aback before his eyes narrowed with skepticism. &#x201c;You intend me to believe you came here to meet your lover?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You may believe what you choose, my lord,&#x201d; she replied sweetly.<br><br>It had taken Rayne little time to realize she was pretending a liaison with him in order to thwart her pursuer. Deciding to go along with the charade for the moment and play the part of her lover, he tightened his arm around her waist possessively and drew her closer to him.<br><br>&#x201c;Ackerby, is it? You should heed the lady&#x2019;s wishes. She has no desire for your company.&#x201d;<br><br>His face darkening, the nobleman swung his gaze to Rayne. &#x201c;Just who the devil are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am Haviland.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The Earl of Haviland?&#x201d; the man asked in apparent recognition.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br><br>Rayne&#x2019;s illustrious title gave Ackerby pause. Evidently it was one thing to pursue a defenseless, unemployed woman. It was quite another to challenge a wealthy earl who could clearly take care of himself and her as well.<br><br>&#x201c;You have no business interfering, sir,&#x201d; Ackerby finally retorted.<br><br>&#x201c;But he does,&#x201d; Madeline countered smoothly. &#x201c;It is you who have no claim to me, my lord.&#x201d;<br><br>Ackerby&#x2019;s tone turned conciliatory. &#x201c;I traveled a great distance on your account, Madeline. I am concerned for your welfare.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed?&#x201d; Her tone had gone dry. &#x201c;I hardly think my welfare was your chief motive in following me. But I have told you numerous times, I am not interested in your proposition. Now perhaps you understand why. I already have a protector.&#x201d;<br><br>She was more than holding her own, Rayne observed, yet he thought it time to intervene. &#x201c;I suggest you take your leave, Ackerby, before I am compelled to assist you.&#x201d;<br><br>The nobleman was clearly disbelieving about being dismissed&#x2014;and furious as well. His gaze skewered first Rayne, then the woman.<br><br>&#x201c;You have not heard the last from me,&#x201d; Ackerby warned her before spinning on his heel and stalking out.<br><br>She had been holding her breath, but after a long moment, she shuddered in relief.<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you for not giving me away,&#x201d; she murmured, turning her head to gaze up at Rayne. &#x201c;Truly, I did not mean to trouble you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was no trouble,&#x201d; he replied lightly. &#x201c;I daresay it flattered my vanity to play your paramour.&#x201d;<br><br>Her cheeks warmed to a becoming pink. &#x201c;I do not usually kiss perfect strangers&#x2014;or anyone else for that matter.&#x201d; Her attention shifted to the weapon he still held at his side. &#x201c;May I have my pistol back, please?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It depends on how you mean to use it. You&#x2019;ll understand my discomfort at the threat you presented when you suddenly appeared.&#x201d;<br><br>Her mouth quirked. &#x201c;You were never in any real danger from me. I only armed myself in case he tried to accost me. Baron Ackerby has . . . less than honorable designs upon my person.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So I deduced,&#x201d; Rayne said. &#x201c;Would you have shot him?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t imagine so, but I thought it better to be prepared.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I take it he offered you a position in his bed and you refused?&#x201d;<br><br>She wrinkled her nose. &#x201c;Certainly I refused. I won&#x2019;t be any man&#x2019;s mistress. Particularly one whose arrogant manner drives me half mad. His conceit will not per- mit him to accept my refusal. But obviously I under- estimated him. I did not expect him to follow me to London.&#x201d; She glanced worriedly at the door again. &#x201c;I believe I will wait here for a while longer, if you don&#x2019;t mind the intrusion.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not in the least, but I should think you would dislike being alone with a stranger.&#x201d;<br><br>That brought her considering gaze back to Rayne. &#x201c;I will take my chances with you. You appear to be a gentleman.&#x201d;<br><br>Rayne returned her regard while drawing his own conclusions about her. She was well spoken, a lady by the sound of it. Her bearing, too, suggested gentility.<br><br>He understood why the baron would want her in his bed. She was not a beauty; in truth, she was rather plain, with square, somewhat masculine features and a sallow complexion. And her hair was a mousy, nondescript brown, which she wore scraped back from her face in a serviceable p...</p><h2>Lost Order Signed</h2><p>SIGNED BY THE AUTHOR, STEVE BERRY! The Knights of the Golden Circle was the largest and most dangerous clandestine organization in American history. It amassed billions in stolen gold and silver, all buried in hidden caches across the United States. Since 1865 treasure hunters have searched, but little of that immense wealth has ever been found. Now, one hundred and sixty years later, two factions of what remains of the Knights of the Golden Circle want that lost treasure one to spend it for their own ends, the other to preserve it. Thrust into this battle is former Justice Department agent Cotton Malone, whose connection to the knights is far deeper than he ever imagined. At the center is the Smithsonian Institution linked to the knights, its treasure, and Malone himself through an ancestor, a Confederate spy named Angus Cotton Adams, whose story holds the key to everything. Complicating matters are the political ambitions of a reckless Speaker of the House and the bitter widow of a United States Senator, who together are planning radical changes to the country. And while Malone and Cassiopeia Vitt face the past, ex-president Danny Daniels and Stephanie Nelle confront a new and unexpected challenge, a threat that may cost one of them their life. From the backrooms of the Smithsonian to the deepest woods in rural Arkansas, and finally up into the rugged mountains of northern New Mexico, The Lost Order is a perilous adventure into our country s dark past, and a potentially even darker future.</p><p></p><h2>Henri Cartier-Bresson: Scrapbook</h2><p><p><strong>Henri Cartier-Bresson's famous scrapbook from the 1940s, published in its entirety for the first time.</strong></p><p>Henri Cartier-Bresson was taken prisoner by the Germans in 1940. After two unsuccessful attempts, he managed to escape in 1943. During this period, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, assuming that the photographer had died in the war, started preparing what they thought would be a posthumous exhibition of his work. When he reappeared, Cartier-Bresson was delighted to learn of the exhibition and decided to review his entire oeuvre and curate it himself.</p><p>In 1946 Cartier-Bresson traveled to New York with about 300 prints in his suitcase, bought a scrapbook, glued in the photos, and brought that album to MoMA's curators. His exhibition there, a celebration of his survival, opened on February 4, 1947.</p><p>In the 1990s, Cartier-Bresson once again turned his attention to this scrapbook. Following his death in 2004, the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson, the present owner of the prints, finished the job of restoring them, making it possible to bring a large body of his extraordinary work to the public, images that have now become a memorial collection after all.</p></p><p><p><strong>Michel Frizot</strong> is Research Director at the Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris. He lives in France.</p><p><strong>Agnes Sire</strong> is the Director of the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> Coinciding with a recent exhibition jointly curated by the Fondation Henri Cartier-Bresson and the International Center of Photography, this splendid selection of more than 300 images presents the iconic French photographer's famous 1930s&#x2013;1940s scrapbook. Published in its entirety for the first time, it contains many of the pictures that cemented Cartier-Bresson's reputation as one of the 20th century's defining image makers. During World War II, the Museum of Modern Art arranged what its curators thought would be a posthumous exhibition of his work, following his capture by the Germans in 1940. Four years later, the museum discovered that Cartier-Bresson had escaped and survived in hiding. He gladly collaborated with MoMA and brought 300 prints in a scrapbook to New York. Now handsomely reprinted, the collection spans from 1932 to 1946, and includes vivid portraits of Matisse, Picasso, Bonnard and Giacometti, as well as street photography, assigned photo essays and reportage of France's tumultuous war years. Image after striking image reveals Cartier-Bresson's consistency in capturing poignant moments in perfectly composed frames. The scrapbook is notable both for the history and the personalities it records, and for Cartier-Bresson's miraculous ability to be at the right place at the right time. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The German monk had already been excommunicated the year before, after nailing his Ninety-Five Theses which accused the Church of rampant corruption to the door of a Saxon church. Now, the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V called for Luther to be apprehended and punished as a notorious heretic.&#x201d; The edict was akin to a death sentence: If Luther was caught, he would almost inevitably be burned at the stake, his fragile movement crushed, and the nascent Protestant Reformation strangled in its cradle.<br><br>In <i>Luther's Fortress</i>, acclaimed historian James Reston, Jr. describes this crucial but little-known episode in Luther's life and reveals its pivotal role in Christian history. Realizing the danger to their leader, Luther's followers spirited him away to Wartburg Castle, deep in central Germany. There he hid for the next ten months, as his fate and that of the Reformation hung in the balance. Yet instead of cowering in fear, Luther spent his time at Wartburg strengthening his movement and refining his theology in ways that would guarantee the survival of Protestantism. He devoted himself to biblical study and spiritual contemplation; he fought both his papist critics and his own inner demons (and, legend has it, the devil himself); and he held together his fractious and increasingly radicalized reform movement from afar. During this time Luther also crystallized some of his most significant ideas about Christianity and translated the New Testament into German an accomplishment that, perhaps more than any other, solidified his legacy and spread his bold new religious philosophy across Europe.<br><br>Drawing on Luther's correspondence, notes, and other writings, <i>Luther's Fortress</i> presents an earthy, gripping portrait of the Reformation's architect at this transformational moment, revealing him at his most productive, courageous, and profound.</p><p><b>James Reston, Jr.</b> is the author of sixteen books, including the international bestseller Warriors of God.

She won the Spectrum Award for her short story, &#34;Three Letters from the Queen of Elfland.&#34;Monette continues the fantastic saga begun in <i>M�lusine</i> and <i>The Virtu </i>with virtuoso narratives of theatrical, political and magical intrigues. Within the walled city of M�lusine, destabilized by unsolved murders and the lack of a legitimate royal heir, stands the fortress known as the Mirador, from which wizards strive to consolidate and increase their power. Felix Harrowgate, the Mirador's most powerful wizard, and his half-brother, former assassin Mildmay the Fox, find themselves mired in new intrigues when Mildmay's lover, the renowned actress Mehitabel Parr, becomes an unwilling spy for the rival wizards of the Bastion. Felix is further distracted by endless bickering with his partner, Gideon Thraxios, and trying to understand the implications of the backwards sky in the magical dreamworld of the Khlo�danikos. Mehitabel fears the destruction of her theatrical company, and the lowborn Mildmay struggles against the prejudice of wizards and lords. Though Felix's more esoteric magical problems remain unresolved, several plot lines find satisfying conclusions, and a well-developed world waits to be explored in sequels. <i>(Aug.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The tank destroyer (TD) was a bold-if some would say flawed-answer to the challenge posed by the seemingly unstoppable German blitzkrieg. The TD was conceived to be light and fast enough to outmaneuver panzer forces and go where tanks could not. At the same time, the TD would wield the firepower needed to kill any German tank on the battlefield. Indeed, American doctrine stipulated that TDs would fight tanks, while American tanks would<br>concentrate on achieving and exploiting breakthroughs of enemy lines.<br><br>The Tank Killers follows the men who fought in the TDs from the formation of the force in 1941 through the victory over the Third Reich in 1945. It is a story of American flexibility and pragmatism in military affairs. Tankdestroyers were among the very first units to land in North Africa in 1942. Their first vehicles were ad hoc affairs: Halftracks and weapons carriers with guns no better than those on tanks and thin armor affording the crews considerably less protection. Almost immediately, the crews realized that their doctrine was incomplete. They began adapting to circumstances, along with their partners in the infantry and armored divisions. By the time that North Africa was in Allied hands, the TD had become a valued tank fighter, assault gun, and artillery piece. The reconnaissance teams in TD battalions, meanwhile, had established a record for daring operations that they would continue for the rest of the war.<br><br>The story continues with the invasion of Italy and finally that of Fortress Europe on 6 June 1944. By now, the brass had decreed that half the force would convert to towed guns, a decision that dogged the affected crews through the end of the war. The TD men encountered increasingly lethal enemies, ever more dangerous panzers that were often vulnerable only to their guns while American tank crews watched in frustration as their rounds bounced harmlessly off the thick German armor. They fought under incredibly diverse conditions that demanded constant modification of tactics. Their equipment became ever more deadly. By VE day, the tank destroyer battalions had achieved impressive records, generally with kill/loss rates heavily in their favor. Yet the Army after the war concluded that the concept of a separate TD arm was so fundamentally flawed that not a single battalion existed after November 1946.<br><br>The Tank Killers draws heavily on the records of the tank destroyer battalions and the units with which they fought.

Born in the late 1970s to fugitive leaders of the Weather Underground and grandson of Communists, spiritual pacifists, and civil rights agitators, Jones grew up an heir to an American tradition of resistance. Yet rather than partake of it, he took it upon himself to document it. The result is a book of extraordinary reporting and narrative. <br> The dramatic saga of <i>A Radical Line</i> begins in 1913, when Jones's maternal grandmother was born, and ends in 1981, when a score of heavily armed government agents from the Joint Anti-Terrorism Task Force stormed into four-year-old Thai's home and took his parents away in handcuffs. In between, Jones takes us on a journey from the turn-of-the-century western frontier to the tenements of melting-pot Brooklyn, through the Great Depression, the era of McCarthyism, and the Age of Aquarius. <br> Jones's paternal grandfather, Albert Jones, committed himself to pacifism during the 1930s and refused to fight in World War II. The author's maternal grandfather, Arthur Stein, was a member of the Communist Party during the 1950s and refused to collaborate with the House Un-American Activities Committee. His maternal grandmother, Annie Stein, worked closely with civil rights legends Mary Church Terrell and Ella Baker to desegregate institutions in Washington, D.C., and New York City. <br> His father, Jeff Jones, joined the violent Weathermen and led hundreds of screaming hippies through the streets of Chicago to clash with police during the Days of Rage in 1969. Then Jeff Jones disappeared and spent the next eleven years eluding the FBI's massive manhunt. Thai Jones spent the first years of his life on the run with his parents. <br> Beyond the politics, this is the story of a family whose lives were filled with love honored and betrayed, tragic deaths, painful blunders, narrow escapes, and hope-filled births. There is the drama of a pacifist father who must reconcile with a bomb-throwing son and a Communist mother whose daughter refuses to accept the lessons she has learned in a life as an organizer. There are parents and children who can never meet or, when they do, must use the ruses and subterfuge of criminals to steal a hug and a hello. <br> Beautifully written and sweeping in its scope, <i>A Radical Line</i> is nothing less than a history of the twentieth century and of one American family who lived to shake it up.</p><p>"Thai Jones relates the lives of two families without much money or success in the usual sense but in which men and women tried to live by their political and ethical ideas no matter what the cost. Jones treats it all with sympathy and a sly irony. He has an exciting story to tell, and he tells it well." -- Marge Piercy <p>"A Radical Line is provocative, funny, heartbreaking, and touching in turn. Thai Jones combines a journalist's nose, an ethnographer's endurance, and a novelist's hand as he brings to life an array of memorable characters, each making his or her twisty way through the tempest of their times. The result is a finely crafted and expertly calibrated memoir of real literary merit that echoes down the decades as a fitting homage to those who lived their lives against the grain." -- William Ayers, Distinguished Professor of Education, University of Illinois at Chicago, and author of Fugitive Days: A Memoir </p><p>"'The Personal Is Political,' wrote a feminist writer in 1969; Thai Jones's beautifully rendered account of his radical family's history helps us understand the complex meaning of that oft-quoted phrase. Alternately painful and inspiring, this is a story that will help a new generation understand why memories of the 1960s still divide Americans." -- Dan T. Carter, author of Scottsboro and The Politics of Rage </p><p>"A wonderfully readable, often harrowing, story of the Americans in two families who felt compelled to defy their government and how and why they did so. In a time of war and vile deception, this is a most powerful, timely story. I loved this book." -- Gloria Emerson, author of Loving Graham Greene </p><p>"The real Running On Empty. A look back across three generations of a committed family. Full of love and drama and patriotism in the best sense of the word. You need to read this book." -- Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal, Academy Award-nominated screenwriter of Running On Empty</p><b>Chapter 1: Cobblestones</b><br><br>Two young women climbed the stairs to an elevated rail platform in Brooklyn during the summer of 1929. One of them walked with a cane, and the other's legs were hampered by a long black coat that was anything but stylish. Their school day had just ended, and they stood a few paces apart waiting for the train to Coney Island. On the street below, nothing stirred unless it had to. Glass, steel, stone, concrete: everything in the borough absorbed the sun and was too hot to touch. Carefully shaded groceries were rank and rotten by midmorning, while fat flies swarmed around the steaming trash piled on the sidewalk.<br><br>Evelyn Wiener, known to her Yiddish-speaking friends as Chavy, was taking summer classes because she had flunked geometry. Only fifteen years old, a childhood case of polio forced her to walk with the aid of a wooden cane. Her father had been a charter member of the American Communist Party, and Chavy remembered well the night when the czar had been overthrown. She had been only three in 1917 and had toddled out in wonder to watch her parents and all their friends drinking vodka in celebration. She had grown up in the Party. As a girl she had been a Young Pioneer and recently, though she was not yet sixteen and had lied about her age, she had joined the Young Communist League.<br><br>Chavy and her radical friends had their own language and style. The men wore leather jackets, and the women went without makeup. Looking at the second girl on the train platform, Chavy thought she spotted a fellow traveler. Only a Red would wear that loose-fitting coat that whipped around the stranger's legs every time a train tornadoed by.<br><br>The girl in the distinctive outfit was Annie Steckler, my grandmother. She was a year older than Chavy and also in summer school. Until recently she had been a fine student, but her father, Philip Steckler, had died a few years earlier, and her mother had sent her to stay with relatives and gone looking for a new husband. Annie, not surprisingly, had developed a willful stubbornness, a temper, and a sharp tongue.<br><br>But as Chavy discovered after a brief conversation, she was no radical. Jumping at the chance to make a convert, Chavy started bragging about the fearsome strength of the Young Communist League. Finally, carried away with enthusiasm, she warned, "We are becoming a menace!"<br><br>"What," Annie asked, "a little two-by-nothing like you, a menace?" <br><br>The conversation might have ended there. Instead both girls boarded the same train, and Annie listened to stories about the Party. By the time they reached Coney Island, the girls were friends.<br><br>A year later, when Chavy turned sixteen, Annie gave her a copy of Marx's <i>Das Kapital.</i> "If you must be a Communist," she said a bit scathingly, "at least you should know what you're talking about."<br><br>Annie's father had a widow's peak like a ship's prow. He could comb it forward, backward, or to the side, and still it would point down unmercifully to the bridge of his nose. Philip Steckler was born in 1875 in the village of Romny in the Ukraine, which had served for centuries as a farmers' market and a Cossack stronghold against the czars. Narrow and uneven stone streets separated short and moldy stone buildings. It was a place one hardly needed an excuse to leave, but for an ambitious Jewish man, there were excuses aplenty. Violence against the Jewish communities in Russia could break out at any moment, and when Steckler was twenty-eight, it did.<br><br>Kishinev, near the Ukraine's southwestern border, was the kind of city that a young bumpkin from Romny might someday aspire to visit. It was a commercial hub where Jews and Moldavians, Russians, Bulgarians, and Albanians tolerated each other with varying degrees of loathing. In April 1903, during the Easter festival when religious zeal was at its annual zenith, the Christians of the city sacked the houses of the Jewish quarter. After two days of rapine and slaughter, the Jews of Kishinev had forty-three new graves to dig. In the telegraph age, the details of the Easter pogrom were printed in the world's newspapers without delay. International committees denounced the czar, and benevolent societies from every Western capital gathered alms for the victims. Jews living in the town of Romny, one province over, didn't think of Kishinev as a far-off place. For them, the violence was a present threat. Within a year of the pogrom, Annie's father had left the Ukraine and stood on a quay in Hamburg, Germany.<br><br>It was a late December day when he clutched his ticket and climbed uncertainly up a narrow gangplank of the steamer Patricia. The ship's great black stack burped out a breath of coal smoke, and her twin screws started churning the greasy waters of the River Elbe. Philip leaned over the rail or, unused to the motion, lay in his berth as the vessel gathered way toward two European stops -- at Boulogne and Plymouth -- and then the open ocean.<br><br><i>Patricia</i> was one of the Hamburg-American Line's newest steamers, built a few years earlier with room for nearly 2,500 passengers. She offered a luxurious crossing for the lucky few who could spend at least fifty dollars for a private cabin. The remaining four-fifths, almost certainly including Steckler, settled for third-class berths on the lower decks, where they slept in bunks and ate in a common mess. At an average speed of thirteen knots, the passage, even during the rough winter months, was scheduled to take twenty days. Steckler's trip was marred by head winds and heavy seas, including a tidal wave that staggered the ship just as she was entering the Atlantic. Even Captain Reessing, a mariner with more than twenty years of salt in his blood, was rattled by the storm. "I have not known such weather for many years," he said. "The winter of 1882 was very similar to this, but none since then has been nearly so bad."<br><br>On January 11, 1904, the ship, only two days late, navigated between the ice drifts of New York harbor. Steckler's traveling days were nearly done. He had just a few miles more to cross, from Ellis Island east to Brooklyn. Once settled, he married Bessie Volozhinsky, who also came from the Ukraine, and moved into a tenement on Siegel Street in Williamsburg. He and his wife had three daughters: Frieda, Sylvia, and, on March 3, 1913, Annie.<br><br>Siegel Street ran just a few blocks from Manhattan Avenue to Bogart Street, through the center of the busy neighborhood. Shop signs advertised in English and Hebrew. The streets were paved with bumpy stones and carried a stream of trucks to the local centers of industry -- Max Blumberg's Lumber Yard and the six-story factory of the New York American Bed Company -- which were the Stecklers' near neighbors. Annie was raised amid the ruction and grew as accustomed to it as her cat, Beryle, who liked to sleep in the gap left by a missing cobblestone and whose slumber went undisturbed even when the trolley car passed inches above her whiskers. <br><br>The Steckler family was poor, but Annie didn't realize it because everyone she knew lived in poverty as well. She shared a bedroom with her sisters, and the only heat in the apartment came from the kitchen stove. On Siegel Street, it was common for several families to use the same bathroom but uncommon for the faucets in that bathroom to run hot water. There were almost no parks or playgrounds in the neighborhood, so Annie would beg her mother for six cents so she could go to Coney Island. The subway ride cost a nickel, and the penny purchased a piece of gum. Then she had to find herself some boy and get him to pay the train fare home.<br><br>Annie's father was a pushcart peddler. He sold sweaters on street corners, barking his spiel and haggling with customers from sunrise to evening. During holidays, savvy vendors staked out a desirable location at night and then slept beneath their carts. But on most days, Philip Steckler left for work near dawn and took Annie with him. She watched him unchock the wooden wagon wheels, lean his shoulder-weight against the bars, and creak his rolling shop down the block. It was a delight to go along with her papa, who accented his Old World upbringing with the charming habit of stopping the cart whenever a lady passed so he could bow and doff his cap.<br><br>Arriving at his accustomed spot, Philip folded and arranged the sweaters to their best advantage; the merchandise would soon be subject to very close inspection. He could afford to carry only a few sweaters at a time. If a customer tried one on -- say, a size 36 -- and found it was too small, Philip would tell her, "Oh, don't worry, I have it in all sizes." Then he would hand the sweater to Annie, who crept down beneath the cart and found not sweaters but boxes -- each labeled with a different size. She took the same sweater the customer had just declared too small, placed it neatly in a box labeled "Size 38," and handed it to her father. He returned it to the lady, who never failed to proclaim it a perfect fit. Then Annie took the money to a nearby wholesaler and bought a new sweater.<br><br>On a summer's night when Annie was ten years old, the thousands of stacked softwood boards in the nearby lumber yard caught fire. Apartment walls along the street were stained black, and windows shattered from the heat while families fled with all their movable possessions. Soon, thousands were watching -- from rooftops and sidewalks -- as every single fireman, fire truck, and fire hose in Brooklyn pitched in to stop the blaze from spreading. "The borough enjoyed a spectacle of destruction that grew more beautiful as darkness furnished a background for an acre or so of billowing flame," a reporter for the <i>New York Times</i> wrote, with the placid objectivity of one whose house was far away. The fire leapt from the lumber yard to the adjacent factory. "After that there was only a seething mass of flame-scoured ruins."<br><br>It was a gloomy horde of revolutionaries that descended on Union Square around midday on May 1, 1932. Bucketfuls of rain collapsed their hat brims, warped their placards, and threatened to turn their May Day into a depressed and drippy mess. Still, 35,000 braved the weather and gamely tried to sing the "Internationale," though the words, instead of rising up to frighten the capitalists in their skyscrapers, got trapped beneath all the umbrellas.<br><br>May Day had begun in America fifty years earlier. Originally held in honor of the anarchists executed in Chicago after the Haymarket riots of 1886, the date was adopted and embraced by the world labor movement. By 1900, the world's assembled Marxists, anarchists, Proudhonistes, Mensheviks, and Bakuninites urged workers in all nations to put down their tools each spring and march in a massive demonstration of unity. While it grew in Europe, the tradition wasted away in America. The previous parade, in 1931, though held in perfect weather, had drawn fewer than ten thousand workers. Only now, with the Crisis -- as the Communists called the Great Depression -- lengthening and worsening, were the crowds beginning to demonstrate again in force.<br><br>The gray and dismal day dampened their enthusiasm, but still they looked formidable trudging past William Z. Foster, the leader of the Communist Party, who watched from a reviewing stand. The country's capitalists had taken only token steps to ease the economic crisis and by their unconcern had given the Communists the means to make a movement. They had, in effect, written these signs -- these sodden placards heavy with damp -- that named the demands that workers were suddenly willing to march for: free rent, free coal, free food, unemployment insurance, pensions, work.<br><br>The crowd showed its first spark when it passed by the rival gathering of Pinks in Rutgers Square. The only thing a Communist could tolerate less than a capitalist was a Socialist, and as they passed by the headquarters of the <i>Jewish Daily Forward,</i> the Socialist newspaper, they whistled and jeered. "Down with the yellow press," they shouted. "Down with Socialism!"<br><br>Otherwise, the procession's only outward vigor came from the students who marched under banners from Columbia, New York University, and City College. The women wore red dresses and kerchiefs; the men had blue shirts and caps. They were happy and fervent despite the slick streets and heavy downpour. Every so often they shouted, "We Confess Communism" and then burst into self-conscious laughter or looked around to see who was yelling loudest.<br><br>For Annie, a sophomore at Hunter College, and Chavy, who had never completed high school, May Day was the highlight of the year. Entering from any of the narrow streets into the open space of Union Square, they could see crowds of people packed in, craning and peering at the speakers. The square had been the site of protest rallies for Emma Goldman in the 1890s, and though it was actually named for the intersection of the Bowery and Broadway, the name Union Square had an irresistible attraction for the labor movement. Walled in by fading stone and brick office buildings, the square had movie theaters and discount department stores that were popular with working-class crowds. Standing side-by-side-by-side on Fourteenth Street were the offices of the city's three progressive newspapers: the <i>Forward,</i> the <i>Daily Worker,</i> and the Yiddish-language <i>Freiheit.</i><br><br>After a few hours of marching, Annie and the other students arrived at the rally point. There they learned that the adults had thrown in the towel and cancelled the speeches. Still in a holiday mood and with the sudden gift of a free afternoon, they dispersed noisily into the subways. May Day was over; leaflets and signs littered the sidewalks. The city's capitalists were safe for another year.<br><br>The Depression was an exhilarating time to be young and radical. Annie had rarely been outside Brooklyn -- a trip to Coney Island had been a holiday -- but in long discussions about international affairs or abstract economic questions, she widened her world far beyond the boundary of Kings County. There was a range of political opinion available: one could be a Socialist or a Communist. The Democratic Party was for the Irish. As for becoming a Republican, neither Annie nor any of her wide acquaintance could ever recall meeting one.<br><br>New York was the center of it all. There, young workers and young students could read dozens of newspapers or listen to soapbox street speakers. Unlike other cities, New York also had two free institutions for higher learning. City College, in Harlem, was overrun with Jewish radicals who scorned their tired old professors and skipped class to hold rambunctious debates in odd corners of the cafeteria. Hunter College, with campuses on the East Side and in the Bronx, provided the best, and usually the only, chance for New York's poor but promising girls to attain their degrees. The students came from workers' families that could spare the extra paycheck that a girl could bring home from the typing pool or shirtwaist factory. Hunter women were acutely aware of the opportunity they had being given and remained impeccably respectable in their marcelled hair and V-neck sweaters. But by the time Annie arrived in 1931, even they were dabbling in politics.<br><br>In a questionnaire given to Annie's class of 750 incoming freshmen, only one girl reported that she intended to marry. Most of the others planned careers in medicine, journalism, teaching, and the law. Between cigarette advertisements for Lucky Strikes and Chesterfields, the <i>Hunter Bulletin</i> was crowded with their intellectual activity: from debates on the "Present Economic Status of Woman" or the "Prospects of British Empire" to reviews of the college production of <i>The Mikado.</i> These refined attai...</p><h2>Psychotherapy and Existentialism: Selected Papers on Logotherapy</h2><p>Psychotherapy and Existentialism: Selected Papers on Logotherapy</p><p></p><h2>Ride the Wild River (Originally The Runaway) (Reno Western Saga #3)</h2><p>A frightened teenage runaway fleeing a brutal stepfather hires Reno to ride west with a wagon train.</p><p></p><h2>A Collection of Blessings (VALUE BOOKS)</h2><p><p>Favored poet Helen Steiner Rice's beautiful verse has been treasured for decades.

And when the United States launches an attack on the terrorist's base of operation in Afghanistan, killing his daughter, retaliation against America is inevitable.<br><br>Now, Kirk McGarvey is in for the race of his life, and a race against time. McGarvey has to find out how the bomb will get to the United States, where it will be detonated, and when this, the worst terrorist attack in U.S. history, will take place. But not only must McGarvey stop the bomb, he must protect his own daughter and the daughter of the president of the United States for a savage act of retaliation by a man gone mad.</p><p>When Saudi zillionaire Osama bin Laden speaks, Allen Trumble, CIA chief of station in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, listens. When bin Laden breaks the news that he's the proud owner of a Russian-made, suitcase-sized nuclear device and wonders if there might not be someone else higher up that he might speak to, the call goes out to Kirk McGarvey, deputy director of operations. A call also goes out to some very bad men who, upon the Trumble family's return to the States, slaughter the lot of them in, of all places, a Disney World parking lot.<p> The administration, never bin Laden boosters, thinks even less of him after the Disney World hit, but the man does have a bomb, so off McGarvey goes to Afghanistan for a face-to-face and a look-see. Once McGarvey's in situ--and after bin Laden surgically removes a homing device from his body--the president becomes convinced that McGarvey's been killed and orders a retaliatory strike. It misses bin Laden but hits and kills his beloved 19 year-old-daughter, Sarah. </p><p> This time, as they say, it's personal, and bin Laden knows just what to do with his bomb. Detonate the little bugger below the Golden Gate Bridge just as President Haynes's Down's syndrome-afflicted daughter is passing above. Tick, tick, tick, tick.</p><p> And so goes <i>Joshua's Hammer</i>, David Hagberg's umpteenth thriller and the eighth entry (after 1999's <i>White House</i>) in his popular Kirk McGarvey adventure series. The premise is less than original, but fans of Clancyesque techno-thrillers won't necessarily be disappointed. The book moves well despite Hagberg's off-the-rack prose and characterizations, and, if the reader can navigate the babble-strewn home stretch, delivers a none-too-surprising yet satisfying finish. <i>--Michael Hudson</i></p>David Hagberg is a former Air Force cryptographer who has traveled extensively in Europe, the Arctic, and the Caribbean and has spoken at CIA functions.

The book, which takes into account Japanese and Asian documents and scholarship in addition to American and European sources, chronicles events in the Pacific from 1853 to 1951. During those years, the leaders of Japan, believing in the superiority of their nation and culture, sought to dominate East Asia and the Pacific Basin. That period also saw Japan and America becoming entangled in each other's national affairs, starting when Commodore Perry's ships ended Japan's isolation policy, and continuing into the occupation by the U. S. Army following the war.<br><br>Author Hoyt shows conflicting personalities and historical context that led to the rise of Japanese militarism and wars with China and Russia. <i>Japan's War</i> examines the decisions that led to the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the escalating climate of violence that resulted in the Rape of Nanking and the Bataan Death March.</p><p>Edwin P.

Beehler set off on a solo four-month trek to track songbird migration and the northward progress of spring through America. Traveling via car, canoe, and bike and on foot, Beehler followed woodland warblers and other Neotropical songbird species from the southern border of Texas, where the birds first arrive after their winter sojourns in South America and the Caribbean, northward through the Mississippi drainage to its headwaters in Minnesota and onward to their nesting grounds in the north woods of Ontario. In <i>North on the Wing</i>, Beehler describes both the epic migration of songbirds across the country and the gradual dawning of springtime through the U.S. heartland--the blossoming of wildflowers, the chorusing of frogs, the leafing out of forest canopies--and also tells the stories of the people and institutions dedicated to studying and conserving the critical habitats and processes of spring songbird migration. Inspired in part by Edwin Way Teale's landmark 1951 book <i>North with the Spring</i>, this book--part travelogue, part field journal, and part environmental and cultural history--is a fascinating first-hand account of a once-in-a-lifetime journey. It engages readers in the wonders of spring migration and serves as a call for the need to conserve, restore, and expand bird habitats to preserve them for future generations of both birds and humans.</p><p>BRUCE M. BEEHLER is an ornithologist, naturalist, conservationist, author, and lecturer. He is a research associate in the division of birds at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. He is best known for coleading a survey of biological diversity in the Foja Mountains of Papua New Guinea in 2005, during which the Wattled Smoky Honeyeater was discovered and the Bronze Parotia and Golden-fronted Bowerbird were photographed for the first time. He has published eleven books about nature, most recently <i>Birds of New Guinea</i>.<i><b>NATURE<br></b></i>Beehler&#x2019;s 100-day account is both deeply informed by conservation science and history, and lit by euphoric moments such as seeing roseate spoonbills duelling with &#x201c;absurd spatulate bills&#x201d;, or a cerulean tide of blue jays in flight over Wisconsin wolf country.<i><b><br></b></i><br><i><b>BIRD WATCHER'S DIGEST</b></i><br>[Beehler's] career was as a professional research ornithologist--he is an expert on the birds of New Guinea--but he is a bird watcher, too, and his deep fascination for natural history and understanding of the relationship between birds, physical geography, and the interconnected web of life on which birds depend permeates every page.<i><b><br><br>LIBRARY JOURNAL</b></i><b>, STARRED REVIEW</b><i><b><br></b></i>What ornithologist Beehler describes as the mere retracing of a classic 1947 account of the spring bird migration northward through the United States becomes a travelog liberally spiced with bird watching, natural history, political commentary, and U.S. history. Its focus is Beehler&#x2019;s bird-watching pursuit from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada&#x2019;s Boreal forest; 37 species of colorful warblers. Other topics that affect bird populations regularly enrich the narrative: unique state parks and feral cats, the Lincoln-Douglas Debates, and the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers&#x2019; attempts to control the course of the Mississippi River. After three months of camping, hiking, biking, bird-watching, and musing about an array of subjects, Beehler checks off the last of the 37 warblers on his list in New York&#x2019;s Adirondacks: the blackpoll warbler. VERDICT This debut will satisfy a variety of readers; those interested in bird-watching, natural and American history, and travelogs will find Beehler&#x2019;s story especially appealing.<i><br><br><b>BOOKLIST</b></i><br>Inspired by the travelogues of naturalist Edwin Teale, ornithologist Beehler decided to embark on a variation of Teale&#x2019;s 1951 migration study and follow modern-day songbirds, starting in the southern U.S. and traveling along the Mississippi up to northern Ontario. Beehler was also determined to learn about field biologists studying migratory birds on his route and how groups are working to restore migratory habitats. This was a more structured scientific journey than Teale&#x2019;s, although Beehler relished camping and brought along a kayak and bicycle to supplement his local forays. He focuses heavily on the presence of various warblers, a small songbird easily overlooked by casual birders, and imparts everything from the most basic facts of migration to the more curious, such as songbird &#x201c;fall-outs,&#x201d; which occur when weather can cause thousands of birds to literally fall out of the sky&#x2014;and survive! As conservationists discuss how modern forestry must include active &#x201c;disturbance,&#x201d; Beehler expands on the complex work necessary to preserve migratory patterns. A charming and enjoyable sojourn in the company of a witty and knowledgeable guide.<br><br><i><b>KIRKUS REVIEWS</b></i><br>A valuable source of information for songbird lovers and dedicated bird-watchers<br><br><i><b>CHOICE</b></i><br>This absorbing travelogue by a Smithsonian ornithologist owes inspiration to Edwin Way Teale&#x2019;s classic <i>North with the Spring</i> (1951). For 100 days in 2015, the author travels from coastal Texas up the Mississippi River Valley, then to northern Ontario and the Adirondacks. He drives, bikes, hikes, canoes, and camps every night, following the spring migration in a quest to see all 37 varieties of eastern&nbsp;warblers. He explores solo or with local experts, musing on the history of these areas and providing insightful commentary on the mixed effects of river levees, conservation, pollution, acid rain, climate change, hunting, fishing, monocultural agriculture, extraction industries, forestry practices, and trapping. Of special interest are Beehler&#x2019;s discourses on Native Americans and the changes humans have wrought on the land. The weighty issues he describes are enhanced by his sense of wonder and enjoyment of the trip, often at lesser-known parks and campgrounds. Not&nbsp;a reference book yet much more than a journal, <i>North on the Wing&nbsp;</i>makes a superb addition to collections on natural history, American history, and travel writing. An authoritative treasure and well-reasoned cri de coeur (with excellent chapter bibliographies).<br>&#x201c;As a newly infatuated birdwatcher, I was transported by Bruce Beehler&#x2019;s <i>North on the Wing</i>. In the guise of a travelogue, Beehler&#x2019;s account takes us on the ultimate no-frills road trip to tiny towns and hidden birding paradises to observe the miraculous touchdown of songbirds returning to our shores after surviving impossible odds to get here. Infused with scientific knowledge and personal passion, <i>North on the Wing </i>should serve as a companion to Steinbeck&#x2019;s <i>Travels with Charley</i>, destined to be a classic on the shelves of birders, naturalists, conservationists, and nature lovers alike.&#x201d;&#x2014;Amy Tan, author of <i>The Joy Luck Club</i> and <i>Where the Past Begins</i><br>&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;From the coastal cheniers of Texas to the boreal forests of Canada, <i>North on the Wing</i> takes us on the adventure of a lifetime: a migration north with billions of songbirds. Beehler weaves together deep, colorful tales of people and places with the biology of the birds themselves in masterful prose. Readers feel as though they are watching warblers, vireos, and thrushes through their own binoculars.&#x201d;&#x2014;Peter P. Marra, director, Smithsonian Migratory Bird Center<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Experience the epic journey of bird migration through the eyes and ears of one of the leading birdwatchers and authors in North America. Bruce Beehler allows us to see the amazing natural spectacle of spring migration through an epic adventure inspired in part by the 1947 travels of Edwin Way Teale and his wife, Nellie&#x2014;a journey that gave rise to the classic American natural history book <i>North with the Spring</i>. Beehler&#x2019;s multistate, hundred-day odyssey allows us to live vicariously through his birding and carries an important conservation message in a time when the fate of songbirds hangs in a precarious balance. I can&#x2019;t recommend it highly enough.&#x201d;&#x2014;Michael J.

Her most enduring writings include <i>Memories of a Catholic Girlhood, The Group</i>, and <i>The Stones of Florence</i>, all available as Harvest paperbacks."A witty, moving, instructive and wise novel�a gem of American social history as well as very good fiction." -- <i>The Nation</i><br><br>"An admirable piece of fiction and the best book [Mary McCarthy] has written." -- <i>Saturday Review</i><br><br>"Juicy, shocking, witty, and almost continually brilliant." -- <i>Cosmopolitan</i><br><br>Mary McCarthy's <i>The Group</i> is a sharply-pointed satire of upper-class New England society which follows the post-college lives of eight Vassar graduates, class of '33. Helena was registered for Vassar at birth; Pokey forged her mother's signature on her college application in defiance of the family tradition of "being dim-witted and vain of it." Out in the "real" world, Dottie loses her virginity to a "bad sort" but discovers that she enjoys sex, while Kay subsumes her own talent to the artistic "genius" of her egocentric and philandering husband. Libby writes book reviews that are almost as long as the original material and Polly works as a nurse, while Priss is forced by her pediatrician-husband to go against "tradition" and her inclinations and breastfeed her baby, as proof of his theories. Elinor "Lakey" Eastlake, the sleek, rich leader of the group, travels about Europe and ultimately returns, full of surprises.

In a time of widespread national dissatisfaction and disillusionment that has given rise to new dissent characterized by the Occupy Wall Street movement, the liberal icon shows us how every American can learn from <em>The Seventeen Traditions</em> and, by embracing them, help bring about meaningful and necessary change.<br></p></p><p><p>My boyhood in a small town in Connecticut was shaped by my family, my friends, our neighbors, my chores and hobbies, the town's culture and environment, its schools, libraries, factories, and businesses, their workers, and by storms that came from nowhere to disrupt everything. . . . Yet childhood in any family is a mysterious experience. . . . What shapes the mind, the personality, the character?</p><p>So begins this unexpected and extraordinary book by Ralph Nader. Known for his lifetime of selfless activism, Nader now looks back to the earliest days of his own life, to his serene and enriching childhood in bucolic Winsted, Connecticut. From listening to learning, from patriotism to argument, from work to simple enjoyment, Nader revisits seventeen key traditions he absorbed from his parents, his siblings, and the people in his community, and draws from them inspiring lessons for today's society. Warmly human, rich with sensory memories and lasting wisdom, it offers a kind of modern-day parable of how we grow from children into responsible adults&#x2014;a reminder of a time when nature and community were central to the way we all learned and lived.</p><p>Ralph Nader was recently named by the <em>Atlantic</em> as one of the 100 most influential figures in American history, one of only four living people to be so honored. The son of immigrants from Lebanon, he has launched two major presidential campaigns and founded or organized more than one hundred civic organizations. His groups have made an impact on tax reform, atomic power regulation, the tobacco industry, clean air and water, food safety, access to health care, civil rights, congressional ethics, and much more.</p></p><h2>Building Portsmouth: The neighborhoods &amp; architecture of New Hampshire's oldest city</h2><p>Architectural historian Richard Candee explores Portsmouths evolution from coastal settlement to city of more than a dozen distinct neighborhoods.

These beautiful pastels, housed in collections from London to Los Angeles to Cairo, are rarely exhibited due to their fragility. Published here as a group for the first time in full color, they provide sheer visual delight as well as enormous insight into Delacroix&#39;s endlessly inventive working methods. In his comprehensive introduction, Lee Johnson discusses Delacroix&#39;s interest in the medium of pastel and its place in his oeuvre as a whole, from the first reference to the technique in one of his school exercise books through his last known pastel, a finely wrought, signed version of one of his favorite compositions, &#34;The Education of Achilles&#34;, which he presented to George Sand in 1862. Professor Johnson then treats the pastels in groups, such as studies for paintings, scenes from literature and mythology, North African scenes, and landscapes, flowers, and sky studies; in each case, he includes a full description and provenance of the work.Although Eugene Delacroix never exhibited his pastels and regarded them mainly as a private activity, the French Romantic artist exploited pastel for his own creative ends, producing innovative chromatic and textural effects, reveling in Oriental exotica and exploring tonalities of light and color. The 60 pastels reproduced in color in this attractive album and dating from the 1820s through the 1860s embrace the full range of his subject matter--portraits, nudes, North African scenes, tigers in the wild, nature studies, ancient Greek history, mythological and religious scenes as well as preliminary studies for The Death of Sardanapalus and Women of Algiers in Their Apartment. In contrast to his highly dramatic, often violent oils, his pastels reveal his interest in being true to nature, in mastering the structure and tints of skies, flowers, clouds, faces. Professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, Johnson provides commentaries on the plates plus an informal biographical sketch of the impulsive artist, who held a deeply pessimistic view of the human condition. <p></p><p>Copyright 1995 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Upstairs Wife: An Intimate History of Pakistan</h2><p>A memoir of Karachi through the eyes of its women Rafia Zakarias Muslim-Indian family immigrated to Pakistan from Bombay in 1962 feeling the situation for Muslims in India was precarious and that Pakistan represented enormous promise And for some time it did Her family prospered and the city prospered But in the 1980s Pakistans military dictators began an Islamization campaign designed to legitimate their rule-a campaign that particularly affected women The political became personal for Zakarias family when her Aunt Aminas husband did the unthinkable and took a second wife a betrayal of kin and custom that shook the foundation of her family The Upstairs Wife dissects the complex strands of Pakistani history from the problematic legacies of colonialism to the beginnings of terrorist violence to increasing misogyny interweaving them with the arc of Aminas life to reveal the personal costs behind ever-more restrictive religious edicts and cultural conventions As Amina struggles to reconci</p><p><p>Rafia Zakaria is an author, attorney, and human rights activist who has worked on behalf of victims of domestic violence around the world.

Zakaria was born and raised in Karachi and now lives in Pakistan and the United States, where she serves on the board of directors of Amnesty International USA.</p><b>From Chapter 1: "The Return"&nbsp;<br></b><br>As we entered this Karachi the easy, smiling contours of my mother&#x2019;s face pulled tight and then even tighter. She had fought for this, learning to drive just so she could take us to school, to the best schools, insisting that it could be done and that she could do it. For this she had sat awkwardly between my father and my grandfather, arguing her case against their objections. For this she had tolerated our crying chorus, every Monday and Wednesday, when the instructor from the driving school showed up at the door at 9:00 a.m. sharp. For this, she had tolerated the weeks and months of my grandfather Said, insisting that he, who could not himself drive, must nevertheless accompany her on every trip, because a woman, even one with a driver&#x2019;s license, could not be trusted to drive alone. Her battle to be permitted to drive had not been an easy one.<br> &nbsp;<br> Five years had passed and now she was allowed to drive alone and without my father or grandfather correcting the timing of her turns, the certainty of her navigation. But despite her victory, the descent into this other Karachi, the sweaty, angry, male Karachi, was still my mother&#x2019;s daily test. <br> &nbsp;<br> Because children never pick the right moment to burst in, I blurted out a question that appeared on the periphery of my mind: &#x201c;Is Uncle Sohail dead?&#x201d; My twin brother, Zaid, turned around to glare. I wanted an answer, and so I asked again: &#x201c;Is Uncle Sohail dead?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My mother did not respond when the light turned green, or at the next light, or as we descended even deeper into the city, onto roads flagged by beggars and hawkers and aimless men hanging around corners. She was quiet as we drove past the row of cinemas, the Capri, the Nishat, the Regal, the Star, past the bloody face of Sylvester Stallone, the jutting hips of a Punjabi actress stilled in midgyration. We passed the electronics market with its unlit neon signs (Hitachi, Sanyo, Toshiba) exposing their wiry entrails.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was only as our car pulled up before my brother&#x2019;s school that my mother spoke. &#x201c;No, Uncle Sohail is not dead,&#x201d; she said in the tiny moment before the gates would shut and leave my brother punished for being tardy. &#x201c;He is not dead, but it would have been better if he were.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> These words, my mild-mannered mother&#x2019;s wishes for a man&#x2019;s death, tumbled out behind us, stumbling into our lunch boxes and schoolbooks. I carried them into my classroom, where I took in a lesson on the Indus River valley, where I completed a test on fractions. I said them to myself in recess as I tried to swap my jam sandwich for a carton of fruit juice: &#x201c;He is not dead, but it would have been better if he were.&#x201d;</p><h2>A Llama in the Family</h2><p>When Adam Fine&#39;s mother decides to start a llama-raising business on their Vermont farm, ten-year-old Adam, who only dreams of having a new bike to ride, finds that life is suddenly full of surprises.</p><p>Johanna Hurwitz is the author of over five dozen books for young readers. She is the recipient of many state awards, including the Texas Bluebonnet Award, the Kentucky Bluegrass Award, and the Garden State Children's Choice Award. She lives in Great Neck, NY, and Wilmington, VT.<p>Johanna Hurwitz always knew she wanted to be a writer. She started by telling stories to her brother, who is six years her junior, and she's been making up stories ever since. Born and raised in New York City, she earned her B.A. degree from Queens College and went on to receive a master's in library science from Columbia University. She embarked on a career as a children's librarian, but she never forgot that one day she wanted to write books, too.</p><p>She worked at the New York Public Library and in a variety of other public and school library positions. She also taught graduate courses in children's literature and storytelling at Queens College. When she and her husband, Uri--a college teacher and writer-and their children, Nomi and Beni, moved to Long Island, she continued her library work.</p><p>Although she had told original stories to her children, it was not until they were well along in school that Mrs. Hurwitz actually began to write down her stories. That's why, when children ask her how long it takes to write a book, she replies that her first, <i>Busybody Nora</i>, took her whole life.</p><p>But since then she has been writing with regularity, portraying with humor and sympathy the everyday incidents that are so important to children. She is particularly fond of seven- to nine-year-olds, because they are " so very open and get excited about small things," and she enjoys writing realistic fiction for and about them.</p><p>That these youngsters are equally fond of Mrs. Hurwitz's books is obvious. She has received many child-chosen state awards, including the Texas Bluebonnet Award, the Wyoming Indian Paintbrush Award, the Kentucky Bluegrass Award, the Garden State Children's Choice Award, the West Virginia Children's Book Award, and others.</p><p>In recent years, Johanna Hurwitz has crisscrossed the United States from Juneau, Alaska, to Jackson, Mississippi, and from San Diego, California, to St. Albans, Vermont. She has even spoken abroad, from Morocco to Mozambique and from Portugal to Nicaragua. On these trips she has met and spoken to schoolchildren, teachers, librarians, and parents. She has made many new friends and has often brought home new ideas for her next book.</p><p></p>Grade 3-4-Another winning story from Hurwitz. Adam Fine is excited when his parents hint that there will be a surprise waiting for him when he gets home from school. He decides it must be the new mountain bike he has been wanting, so he is amazed (and a little disappointed) to find that it's a llama. As Adam and his four-year-old sister get to know the strange creature (dubbed Ethan Allen by their mother), it becomes an important part of the family. Adam, however, still wants a new bike and spends most of his time figuring out how to get one. However, when he finds a valuable braided rug in the attic that he could sell, he trades it in order to get another llama to keep Ethan Allen company and to help his mother's growing business, "Fine Llama Treks" for tourists. Hurwitz has created a believable, likable protagonist. While Adam sees himself as a talented wheeler-dealer and is a typical 10-year-old in many respects, he's also wise and considerate. Satisfying in its depiction of a happy, secure Vermont family, this enjoyable tale would fit nicely into any library.<br><i> Jan Shepherd Ross, Dixie Elementary Magnet School, Lexington, KY</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Aurora&#39;s Whole Realms Catalog (Accessory, Forgotten Realms Game)</h2><p>A catalog of items ranging from farm tools to imported silks helps players of Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons and other role-playing games recreate the world of medieval fantasy</p><p></p><h2>A God of Vengeance?: Understanding the Psalms of Divine Wrath</h2><p><p>The aggressive tone of the psalms that deal with violence is often viewed as in direct opposition to Jesus' command to love one's neighbor.

By the author of <i>A Myth of Innocence.</i> Major ad/promo.</p><p>The first book to give the full account of the lost gospel of Jesus&#39; original followers, revealing him to be a Jewish Socrates who was mythologized into the New Testament Christ."Simply stunning in its erudition and winning in its style. Probably better than anyone before him, Burton Mack has allowed the novel voice of this lost gospel to be heard with clarity at the same time as he fixes its position in Mediterranean antiquity. His case is that the Sayings Gospel Q represents a key piece in the puzzle of Christian origins is compelling; equally powerful is his account of what <i>difference</i> Q makes to the understanding of Christian origins." (John S. Kloppenborg, author of <i>Q Parallels</i>) <p>This is the first full account of the lost gospel of Jesus' original followers, revealing him to be a Jewish Socrates who was mythologized into the New Testament Christ. Compiled by his followers during his lifetime, the Book of Q (from <i>Quelle,</i> German for <i>source</i>) became the prime foundation for the New Testament gospels. Once lost, it has been reconstructed through a century of scholarship. In presenting his own translation, Burton Mack explains how the text of Q was determined and explores the implications of the discovery that Jesus was transformed into the dying and rising messianic savior of Christianity by the New Testament gospels. </p><p>Instead of telling a dramatic story about Jesus' life as the Christian gospels do, the Book of Q contained only his sayings. The first followers of Jesus focused not upon his life and destiny, but on the social experiment called for by his teachings. Their book collected his proverbs, aphorisms, and parables to offer instruction in living authentically in the midst of a most confusing time. </p><p>In <i>The Lost Gospel,</i> Burton Mack: </p><p>puts forth the first popular translation of Q as scholarly consensus has reconstructed it; </p><p>shows that Jesus' life story as presented in the New Testament gospels was fictionalized for theological purposes; </p><p>reveals Jesus to be a countercultural teacher and leader--subsequently mythologized into the Christ of the New Testament; </p><p>depicts Jesus' followers not as Christians, but as disciples of a wise, anti-establishment teacher; they did not believe him to be the son of God, believe that he rose from the dead, or gather to worship in his name; </p><p>concludes that Christianity is a mythologized religion (like Buddhism and other religions) rooted in a historical figure and teachings that in reality are quite remote from conventional beliefs. </p><p>"Q challenges the habituated assumptions and patterns of privilege granted the narrative gospels of the New Testament. With Burton Mack's landmark scholarship as a guide, the entire landscape of early Christian history and literature will now have to be revised."

He enlisted in the Granite Mountain Hotshots, a team of elite firefighters based in Prescott, Arizona. Their leader, Eric Marsh, was in a desperate crunch after four hotshots left the unit, and perhaps seeing a glimmer of promise in the skinny would-be recruit, he took a chance on the unlikely McDonough, and the chance paid off. Despite the crew's skepticism, and thanks in large part to Marsh's firm but loving encouragement, McDonough unlocked a latent drive and dedication, going on to successfully battle a number of blazes and eventually win the confidence of the men he came to call his brothers.<br><br>Then, on June 30, 2013, while McDonough--"Donut" as he'd been dubbed by his team--served as lookout, they confronted a freak, 3,000-degree inferno in nearby Yarnell, Arizona. The relentless firestorm ultimately trapped his hotshot brothers, tragically killing all 19 of them within minutes. Nationwide, it was the greatest loss of firefighter lives since the 9/11 attacks. <br><br><i>Granite Mountain</i> is a gripping memoir that traces McDonough's story of finding his way out of the dead end of drugs, finding his purpose among the Granite Mountain Hotshots, and the minute-by-minute account of the fateful day he lost the very men who had saved him.

There was intense curiosity, and even anxiety, about what the new German government really intended. The imposition of domestic tyranny went hand in hand with Germany's repeated public protestations of international peaceful intentions. Yet even as the tyranny within Germany was being directed at those who were considered enemies of the regime, a wave of skillfully organized enthusiasm led to widely reported demands for the carrying out of Nazi ideals. During the first days of May, Nazi students demonstrated against what they called 'non-German culture', demanding an end to what they characterized as alien, and especially socialist and Jewish, influences. Those influences had hitherto been an integral part of German life and culture. On 1 May 1933, the traditional May Day of the working classes, the National Socialist Workers Unions organized a Day of National Work, complete with demonstrations and banners, reminiscent of the great working-class spectacles of earlier years, but with a total hostility to the socialist work ethic and aspirations of the past. The traditional theme of international solidarity was replaced by the call for national renewal. In proclaiming a 'holy day of national labour', Hitler's Minister of Propaganda, Dr Josef Goebbels --- the leading propagandist of Nazism --- declared: 'Germans of all estates, lineages, and professions, join hands! In serried ranks we march into the new age.'</p><p></p><p>On the day after May Day, the buildings of the Socialist Trade Unions were occupied by the Nazis, and all German trade union leaders arrested. This operation was organized by Robert Ley, a chemist by profession, and one of Hitler's earliest supporters, who established a German Labour Front, to be the sole representative of the German working man. In explaining the sudden destruction of the existing trade unions, Ley declared: 'Workers, your institutions are sacred and unassailable to us National Socialists. I myself am a poor son of peasants and have known poverty. I swear to you that we shall not only preserve everything you have, we shall extend the rights of the worker in order that he might enter the new National Socialist State as an equal and respected member of the nation.'</p><p></p><p>Not only the traditional ideals of organized labour but the century-old evolution of German culture was under attack, and not in Germany alone. In Vienna, on May 9, Nazi university students defied the Austrian authorities to raise the Swastika banner, and, as students left the lecture halls, to set upon them with truncheons and sticks studded with nails, crying out, in the words of the Daily Telegraph correspondent, G.E.R Gedye: 'Hail, Hitler, Perish the Jews.' [The first cry soon became universally known in its German form: Heil, Hitler. The second was Juda verrecke. (Verrecken is slang for To kick the bucket).] </p><p>Gedye added: 'The students, including girls, were driven into the lecture room and tried to barricade the door against the Nazi attacks. Many jumped from first floor windows into the street, sustaining nasty injuries.'</p><p></p><p>On the following day, May 10, in Berlin, the Public Prosecutor ordered the immediate confiscation of all the property and funds of the Socialist Party and its allies. All Socialist newspapers were confiscated and the assets of all Socialist organizations seized. It was a final blow to such freedom of Socialist expression that remained: since Hitler had come to power three months earlier the number of Socialist newspapers had declined from well over a hundred to less than twenty.</p><p></p><p>That midnight, in the square facing the Berlin Opera House, and the university, a bonfire of books was lit, photographs of which were to appear within twenty-four hours on the front pages of hundreds of newspapers around the world. But many of the reports of the event poured scorn on it. Under the headline 'SYMBOLIC' HOLOCAUST' DAMPED BY RAIN AND APATHY, the Daily Telegraph Berlin correspondent, Eustace B. Wareing, wrote:</p><p></p><p>The symbolical burning at the stake of Jewish, 'Marxist' and pacifist books which took place here this evening must have been a disappointment to its organizers. The ceremony was damped not only by a heavy and prolonged shower of rain, but also by apathy on the part of the public.</p><p></p><p>As the Opera House Square in which the holocaust was accomplished was reserved for the students and their friends, the only part of the ceremony visible to the wider public was the torchlight procession by which the condemned volumes were escorted to the bonfire.</p><p></p><p>But, though the route followed was not more than two or three miles long, there were, even before the rain began, stretches of as much as one hundred yards on which not a single spectator was stationed.</p><p></p><p>It was quite obvious that the mass of the population is not interested in 'the fight against the un-German spirit'.</p><p></p><p>The procession itself was rather a poor spectacle. It was mainly composed of a few thousand young Nazis, some in the orthodox Storm Detachment uniform, some in the white shirts of the Nazi sporting students, and some, who were lucky in having overcoats, in ordinary civilian dress.</p><p></p><p>There was a small group of Steel Helmet youths, a smattering of girls, and a few dozen schoolboys as a tail to the procession. A Nazi band took the lead, and the students sang their patriotic songs as they marched.</p><p></p><p>'The condemned books were carried in two or three tradesmen's delivery vans,' the correspondent wrote. 'There can hardly have been more than one volume for each member of the escort. The total number collected was under 20,000, and a few hundred weight were sold to a dealer for pulping.'</p><p></p></p><h2>Queen of the Home</h2><p>In past generations, the role of wife and mother was viewed as a sacred calling. The committed homemaker was seen as strong, capable, intelligent, and irreplaceable. She was regarded not only as a crucial part of the home, but as a foundational bulwark of society. She was considered worthy of great honor, appreciation, and respect. Though in recent years feminists have sought to demean this glorious calling, the Bible's hopeful vision of noble womanhood is one worth reclaiming. <i>Queen of the Home</i> seeks to cast that vision afresh through godly encouragements from writers past and present. This inspiring collection of essays, poetry, and poignant vignettes paints a beautiful picture of what it means for a wife to be a crown to her husband, the monarch of the cradle, and queen of the home, and calls upon daughters to embrace their rewarding role and sacred calling as regal women of God.</p><p>Jennifer McBride is a sinner saved by the grace of our merciful God.

Her ear near a hole in the paint-chipped wall of Hard Pan's Found Object Wind Chime Museum and Visitor Center, she listened as Short Sammy told the story of how he hit rock bottom. How he quit drinking and found his Higher Power. Short Sammy's story, of all the rock-bottom stories Lucky had heard at twelve-step anonymous meetings -- alcoholics, gamblers, smokers, and overeaters -- was still her favorite. </p><p> Sammy told of the day when he had drunk half a gallon of rum listening to Johnny Cash all morning in his parked '62 Cadillac, then fallen out of the car when he saw a rattlesnake on the passenger seat biting his dog, Roy, on the scrotum. </p><p> Lucky balanced herself with a hand above the little hole that Short Sammy's voice was coming out of. With her other hand, she lifted the way-too-curly hair off her neck. She noticed two small black birds nearby, panting like dogs from the heat, their beaks open, their feathers puffed up. She put her ear to the hole because Sammy's voice always got low and soft when he came to the tragical end of the story. </p><p> But Short Sammy didn't head right to the good part. To stretch it out and get more suspense going for the big ending, he veered off and told about the old days when he was broke and couldn't afford to buy rum, so he made homemade liquor from cereal box raisins and any kind of fruit he could scrounge up. This was the usual roundabout way he talked, and Lucky had noticed that it made people stay interested, even if the story got quite a bit longer than if someone else had been telling it. </p><p> She stood up, her neck and the backs of her knees sweating, and mashed wads of hair up under the edges of her floppy hat. She carefully angled an old lawn chair with frayed webbing into her wedge of shade, and made sure the chair wouldn't break by easing herself onto it. Flies came, the little biting ones; she fanned them away with her plastic dustpan. Heat blasted off the Dumpster. </p><p> There was a little silence, except for the wobbly ticking noise of the ceiling fan inside and people shifting in their folding metal chairs. She was pretty sure they had already heard the story of Short Sammy hitting rock bottom before, as she had, and that they loved the pure glory and splendiferousness of it as much as she did -- even though it was hard to imagine Short Sammy being drunk. Short Sammy's voice sounded like it could barely stand to say what came next. </p><p> "That Roy, man," said Sammy, who called everyone "man," even people like Lucky who were not men. "He was one brave dog. He killed that snake even though it bit him in the place where it hurts the worst for a male. And there I am, trying to get away, falling out of the Cad. I break a tooth, I cut my cheek, I give myself a black eye, I even sprain my ankle, but I'm so drunk, man, I don't even know I'm messed up -- not till much later. Then I pass out. </p><p> "Next day I wake up on the ground, sand in my mouth, and it feels like death. I mean, it's like I <i>died,</i> man, but at the same time, like I'm too sick and ashamed to be dead. There's a mangled rattlesnake under the car, there's blood, lots of blood -- I don't even know if it's my blood or Roy's or the snake's. Roy's gone. I call him -- nothing. I figure maybe after saving my stupid life he went off to die alone somewhere. It's probably like a hundred degrees in the shade, man, about as hot as it is now, but I'm so cold I can't stop shivering." </p><p> Lucky's hands smelled metallic, like the thin arms of the lawn chair; they felt sticky. She pushed her hat back from her forehead; air cooled the sweat there. </p><p> "I make this deal with myself," Sammy continued. "The deal is if Roy is okay I'll quit drinking, join AA, get clean." </p><p> Lucky edged her bare leg away from a rough, poking strand of chair webbing. Each time Short Sammy came to this part in his story, Lucky thought of what kind of deal she would make with herself if she hit rock bottom. Like, let's say she didn't know if her dog, HMS Beagle, was alive or dead; she would have to do something really hard and drastic as her end of the bargain. Or, let's say that her Guardian just gave up and quit because Lucky did something terrible. The difference between a Guardian and an actual mom is that a mom can't resign. A mom has the job for life. But a Guardian like Brigitte could probably just say, "Well, that's about it for <i>this</i> job. I'm going back to France now. <i>Au revoir."</i> There poor Lucky would be, standing alone in the kitchen trailer, at rock bottom. Then she would have to search for her own Higher Power and do a fearless and searching moral inventory of herself, just like Short Sammy and all the other anonymous people had had to do. </p><p> Short Sammy went on, "Then my wife drives up. Man, I didn't even know she'd gone. I'm still kind of laying there on the ground. She gets out of her car, but she doesn't say one word about how messed up I am. </p><p> "All she says is, 'I took Roy to the vet's in Sierra City.' She's talking real calm, almost like she's not mad or anything. She says, 'Fifty miles from here, and I drove it in, like, maybe half an hour. That was the worst drive of my life, Sammy, thanks to you. But Roy's okay because I got him there in time for the antivenom to work.' </p><p> "Then she goes into the house and comes out with her suitcases that she must have packed the night before, and Roy's food dish and water bowl. <i>That</i> killed me, her taking his food dish and water bowl. All she says to me is, 'Don't call me.' That, man, was rock bottom. So I threw down the shovel. And here I am." </p><p> There was clapping, and Lucky knew that pretty soon they would pass a hat around for people to put money in. It was a little disappointing that today nobody had explained how exactly they had found their Higher Power, which was what Lucky was mainly interested in finding out about. </p><p> She didn't get why finding it was so <i>hard.</i> The anonymous people often talked about getting control of their lives through their Higher Power. Being ten and a half, Lucky felt like she had no control over her life -- partly because she wasn't grown up yet -- but that if she found her Higher Power it would guide her in the right direction. </p><p> Chairs scraped as everyone stood up. Now they would all say a little prayer together, which Lucky liked because there was no church or synagogue or anything in Hard Pan, California, so the Found Object Wind Chime Museum and Visitor Center was the closest they got to one. That meant the end of the meeting and time for her to disappear quick. She'd finished her job of clearing trash from the patio in front -- smashed beer cans and candy wrappers from yesterday's Gamblers Anonymous meeting. It wasn't likely that anyone would be coming back to the Dumpster behind the museum, but someone <i>might.</i> She had to hurry, but she had to hurry <i>slowly,</i> in order not to make a sound. </p><p> She stashed her dustpan and rake beside the wall and left the aluminum lawn chair hidden behind the Dumpster. Tomorrow, Saturday, would be her day off. Then on Sunday afternoon, before the Smokers Anonymous meeting, she would again clean up the museum's little patio. The patio was where the anonymous people sat around talking after their meetings. All the anonymous people left lots of litter, and each group could not bear to see the butts or the cans or the candy wrappers of the group that met before it. The reason was that they were in recovery. The recovering alcoholics hated to see or smell beer cans left by the recovering smokers and gamblers; the recovering smokers could not stand cigarette butts left by the recovering drinkers, and the recovering overeaters hated to see candy wrappers left by the recovering drinkers, smokers, and gamblers.Which meant that Lucky had a job -- a great job -- and except for Dot's kitchen-and-back-porch Baubles 'n' Beauty Salon and the Captain's mail-sorting job at the post office, it was the only <i>paying</i> job in town. </p><p> Wrestling with the straps of her survival kit backpack, which she had with her at all times, then jogging down the dry streambed toward home, Lucky thought of a question that Short Sammy's story had lodged into one of her brain crevices. She figured she had so <i>many</i> crevices and wrinkles, almost all of them filled with questions and anxious thoughts, that if you were to take her brain and flatten it out, it would cover a huge space, like maybe a king-size bed. </p><p> The question of Short Sammy's dog's scrotum settled into one certain brain crevice as she picked her way among the weedy bushes of the dry wash. Even though Lucky could ask Short Sammy almost anything and he wouldn't mind, she could never ask about the story of Roy, since she had overheard it. If she asked about Roy, then he would know that she'd been eavesdropping at the anonymous twelve-step meetings. </p><p> Scrotum sounded to Lucky like something green that comes up when you have the flu and cough too much. It sounded medical and secret, but also important, and Lucky was glad she was a girl and would never have such an aspect as a scrotum to her own body. Deep inside she thought she <i>would</i> be interested in <i>seeing</i> an actual scrotum. But at the same time -- and this is where Lucky's brain was very complicated -- she definitely did not want to see one. </p><p> A little breeze had come up by the time she got home to the half circle of trailers. First was her little shiny aluminum canned-ham trailer, where she and HMS Beagle slept. Next, the long kitchen-dining room-bathroom trailer, and last, Brigitte's Westcraft bedroom trailer. Instead of having wheels and being hooked up to cars to tow them around, the three trailers were mounted on concrete blocks; plus they were anchored to the ground with metal cables to keep from being blown over in windstorms. The best part was that you could walk from Lucky's canned ham to Brigitte's Westcraft without ever going outside, because passageways had been cut where the trailers' ends touched, and sheets of metal had been shaped and s...</p></p><h2>Applying Mathematics Grade 8 Math Teacher&#39;s Manual Part 1</h2><p>Teacher&#39;s Manual Part 1 for Applying Mathematics.

He assists the reader to find his or her place on the Tree of Life, and the notes which echo the Spiritual Development of one s Soul. For the first time we see photos of Maman s Sacred Sound Instruments, used in the teachings of Tama-Do ( The Way of the Soul ), The Academy of Sound, Color and Movement�, including the Giant Pyramid� and the Arche of Sound�.</p><p>Musician/composer, acupuncturist, martial artist and energy researcher <b>Fabien Maman</b> is considered the founding father of vibrational sound therapy (Websters ). After a successful career as a jazz musician, in 1977 Maman became an acupuncturist, linking music with acupuncture. He created the now famous system which uses tuning forks and color lights instead of needles on acupuncture command points. <br> In the early 80s, Maman conducted his revolutionary sound/cellular biology experiments documenting the impacts of sound on human cells. For the first time under a microscope, Maman proved that acoustic sound can revitalize healthy cells as well as destroy cancer cells.<br> This became the driving theory behind Maman s work: <i>that blockages in our subtle energy fields can result in physical illness if they are allowed to crystallize, and Sound, Color and Movement� are the most effective tools we can use to dissolve negative energetic patterns. </i><br> In 1988 Maman founded <b>Tama-Do</b>, (<i> The Way of the Soul </i>),<b> The Academy of Sound, Color and Movement�</b>, offering trainings for the evolution of conscousness using non-invasive vibrational techniques composed of Sound, Color and Movement� and Seasonal Harmonizing Concerts�.<br> For nearly 30 years, Maman has created research and practical applications to balance the body, mind and spirit through the subtle energy fields. He has created more than 30 techniques through the Academy, each of which took nearly seven years to test and apply.<br> Maman is the author of a series of four books: <b> From Star to Cell: A Sound Structure for the Twenty-First Century </b>. These books include: <b> The Role of Music in the Twenty-First Century , Raising Human Frequencies The Way of Chi and The Subtle Bodies , The Body as a Harp Sound and Acupuncture and Healing with Sound, Color and Movement Nine Revolutionary Healing Techniques. </b> His fifth book, just released, is <b> Accessing the Way of the Soul through Color. </b> Maman, who teaches and lectures around the world, has numerous CDs and videos as well. 800.615.3675."I met Fabien Maman over twenty years ago... I have continued to observe his way since then. He has created so many amazing yet real ways to heal with pure sound, color and chi movment. This is how he offers love to others." --Jacques Duponchelle, Founder of Research in Subtle Healing, France<br><br>"Upon meeting Fabien and directly learning about his research we became convinced of the important need for his research to be more fully disseminated throughout the world. Here is a man who is a musician/composer that has played inspiring music in concert halls around the world; a martial artist who understands about control of the body; a healer that has developed a non-intrusive system of bringing sick and out-of-balance bodies back to their natural harmony.<br> Our organizational mandate is to identify all healing techniques from ancient times to the present, representing all areas from traditional to non-traditional. Here with the important work of Fabien Maman we have a researcher that is not only showed us the importance of acoustic sound as it is a part of creation, but he has been able to utilize his awareness to bring an individual back into harmony with their own nature, with Nature, and this can only lead to a more harmonious world as a whole. As he has stated, within each harmonizing concert, the individual is not only tuned and harmonized within his/her own cellular DNA, acupuncture meridians, organs, Chakras and energy fields, but is also tuned in a greater expanding spiral including the elements of nature, the seasons, the community and beyond. The only other person that had such awareness of sound and the Universe was the great Pythagoras. <br> Since 1984, the World Research Foundation has accumulated over 30,000 books dating to the 1400s in a variety of health and philosophical regimes, we have an Advisory Board that has been comprised of accomplished and world recognized scientists and medical doctors including a past Chairman of the Nobel Assembly; the head physician for NASA, and many other highly qualified specialists. We consider the research and practical applications of Fabien Maman work to be as important, as necessary, as beneficial as anyone whom we have been associated with or gathered information about. In this time and era in the world it seems that many of our new innovations, while supposedly making our lives better and easier, often have a complexity attached to them. What is truly remarkable about the work of Fabien Maman is that there is a simplicity in the application. This should not be taken to mean that it was easy for Fabien to develop this work. But that he is surrounding us with sound and music. How very natural is this!" --Steven A.

For the first time the hidden power of the word 'Green'-now given to every activity, every person dedicated to stopping the devastation of the Earth and to a new 'greening' of the planet-is revealed in the Green Man as this image appears in the Western cultural tradition, especially in the folk tales, rituals, literature, and art and architecture of pasty centuries. The Green Movement will attain a new efficacy through this new understanding of itself, through the archetype of the Green Man that arises not simply out of our own Western traditions but from the unconscious depths of the human psyche.

Essays on Poetry</h2><p>The winner of the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for poetry examines the styles and attitudes of Eliot, Williams, Dickinson, George Oppen, and other poets, describes her own feelings about reading and her work, and recounts her education in poetry.</p><p>Proofs &amp; Theories is a long-awaited first gathering of essays by one of this country's most brilliant poets. Like her poems, the prose of Ms. Gluck, who won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry in 1993 for The Wild Iris, is compressed, fastidious, fierce, alert, and absolutely unconsoled. The force of her thought is apparent everywhere in her writing and whether she is contemplating - skeptically - the critical currency of ideas like "courage" and "sincerity", T. S. Eliot's reduced reputation as a poet of impersonality, the loyalties of the objectivist George Oppen, or the ferocity in the headlong art of Sylvia Plath, there is something exhilarating about her seriousness, spare, austere, mind-clearing, and adamantly alive. She shares her skepticism with a whole temper of post-modern critical thought. But post-modernism, on the whole, has stood aside from what artists have thought was at stake in their art in order to dissect it. Ms. Gluck is also quite expert - wry sometimes, darkly funny even - at dissection but in these essays one never doubts what is at stake: an art as truthful, adamant, and unflinching as the intelligence that she brings to her own. Proofs &amp; Theories is not a casual collection. It is the testament of a major poet.Louise Gl�ck won the Pulitzer Prize for <em>The Wild Iris</em> in 1993. The author of eight books of poetry and one collection of essays, <em>Proofs and Theories: Essays on Poetry,</em> she has received the National Book Critics Circle Award for Poetry, the William Carlos Williams Award, and the PEN/Martha Albrand Award for Nonfiction. She was named the next U.S. poet laureate in August 2003. Her most recent book is <em>The Seven Ages</em>.

In the eighth offering of the popular RCN series, Leary receives orders to transport a diplomat to Zenobia and orders his communications officer, Adele Mundy, to investigate Palmyra, a semi-barbaric ally that is responsible for securing that sector from piracy. They discover not only that Palmyra is about to invade Zenobia, but that certain rogue RCN officers are actively involved. With the specter of renewed hostilities looming before him, Leary approaches his Alliance counterpart and makes an astounding offer, because "all civilized persons have a duty to stand against barbarians." Drake (As the Tide Rises) deftly weaves a web of political machinations and intrigue that vividly depicts the costs of war.

Abraham Lincoln had been shot at Ford&#x2019;s Theatre, on Tenth Street. The wounds were mortal, people were saying. There was no way he could survive. The war was over, the South utterly vanquished, yet somehow its withered hand had reached up into the nation&#x2019;s capital and extracted this bitter revenge. The crowds became mobs, looking for somebody to hang. Some wanted to burn Ford&#x2019;s to the ground. Others marched toward Old Capitol Prison, where many leaders of the late rebellion were still being held. Rumors passed from mouth to mouth: The Vice- President had been murdered in his rooms at Kirkwood House. The Secretary of State had been stabbed to death in his mansion on Lafayette Square. Confederate troops were advancing on the city. Or Union troops: nobody seemed to know for sure, and a coup d&#x2019;�tat had been rumored for years. Outside Ford&#x2019;s Theatre, a man in the blood-spattered uniform of an army major and a doctor carrying a candle fought their way into the street. A group bearing Lincoln&#x2019;s unmoving body followed behind. Mrs. Lincoln, face like chalk, clutched her husband&#x2019;s stiff hand. People leaned in, trying to see or touch. Men groaned. Women wept. A soldier banged on the door of a row house across the way. They carried the President inside and shut the door. People craned to peer in the windows. Minutes later, Secretary of War Stanton, the most feared man in Washington, arrived in an unguarded carriage and raced inside. Other officials followed. Furious soldiers took up positions on the sidewalk but seemed to have no clear orders. They battered members of the crowd for practice. Other men went in. The people who had been closest to the body passed on the story: the President&#x2019;s head was a mass of blood. <br><br>Meanwhile, the hue and cry had been raised. That actor fellow. Wilkes Booth. He had shot the President and leaped to the stage, then escaped on horseback. Somehow the mob was armed now, looking for someone to whom they might do mayhem. Booth would be best, but any Southern sympathizer or paroled Confederate soldier would do, or, in the absence of so obvious a target, any man dressed in gray, or a Catholic, or a darkie. In the confusion, Stanton took command. He ordered the city sealed. Trains were stopped. Guards allowed no one across the bridges. Telegrams were sent to military commanders in Virginia and Maryland, warning them to watch for men on horses fleeing Washington. On the Potomac River, a steamer was prepared as a floating prison should any of the conspirators be apprehended, the better to protect them from the mob: good order required that they be hanged swiftly by soldiers rather than by citizens. <br><br>The Union had been struck a hard blow, and wanted revenge. <br><br>From Philadelphia to New York to Chicago, newspapers were out with special late editions, their entire front pages devoted to the shooting. Some headlines pronounced the President already dead. Editors who had been Lincoln&#x2019;s sworn foes eulogized him as the nation&#x2019;s savior; others, who had openly despised Mrs. Lincoln, assured the nation that they stood beside the First Lady in her impending widowhood. In the war-ravaged South, where few telegraph lines were intact, the news moved more slowly. Lincoln&#x2019;s longtime bodyguard, Allan Pinkerton, was in New Orleans, and would not learn of the shooting for several days. In the cities of the North, vengeful citizens marched. Church doors were flung open so that people might pray for the President&#x2019;s recovery. But the prayers, like the mobs, seemed fruitless. Everybody knew that it was too late. Little squares of black crepe began to appear in windows, signaling a nation already mourning.<br><br>That was Friday. By Saturday, however, the rumors began to change. Perhaps all was not lost. The doctors had cleaned the wound repeatedly and removed the clotting blood. And a miracle was occurring. The President&#x2019;s indomitable will was asserting itself. He was breathing strongly on his own, his eyes were fl uttering open, and the damage to his brain appeared less severe than first thought. The telegraph flashed the news across the country: <i>Lincoln lives! </i>True, Vice-President Andrew Johnson was dead, and the Secretary of State so badly wounded that he might not see another day, but Abraham Lincoln, savior of the nation, seemed to be improving. <br><br>He had been shot on Good Friday. On Easter Sunday, he rose. <br><br>By the middle of the week, the President was sitting up, meeting with his staff, once again in charge of the affairs of the nation. Across the country, people cheered. Those who felt otherwise kept their disappointment to themselves, content to bide their time.<br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>November 19, 1866</i><br>&nbsp;<br>The night riders were gaining.<br><br>Bending low, the black man spurred his tiring horse down the tangled leaf- strewn lane. On either side, fields thick with brightleaf tobacco stretched into the chilly Virginia darkness. Just a few miles ahead loomed the lower slopes of the Shenandoah, with its welcoming forest. If he could only reach the tree belt, he would be safe. A few miles to the north, an entire brigade of Union troops garrisoned the town of Winchester, but with three hooded pursuers only a few hundred yards behind, his chances of reaching either sanctuary were small. He had a pistol in his saddlebag and a knife in his belt, and he knew that if he slowed to draw either, the night riders would have him. <br><br>That would be bad. <br><br>In a hidden pocket sewn beneath the lining of his right boot was the message. If he was caught and searched, the night riders might find it. <br><br>That would be worse. <br><br>He rode faster. The autumn drizzle turned to steam on the horse&#x2019;s burning flanks. He heard a low crackle that might have been distant lightning or a nearby gunshot. He rounded a bend, jumped a fallen tree, nearly spilled on the other side. Very soon his mount would collapse. <br><br>Pounding hooves and shouting voices carried across the night air. The riders were close behind. He searched for a turnoff but found none. Had he possessed a sense of irony, he might have considered that not far to the south was Appomattox Court House, where, a year and a half earlier, Lee had surrendered the Army of Virginia, ending the Civil War but setting off the more secretive conflict in which he himself was now playing so carefully scripted a part. But there was no time for such musings. The moon had burst from the clouds, and lighted the path to escape.<br><br>Up ahead, the road split into two branches. He took the southmost fork, which led, if he remembered correctly, to a shattered plantation and an old church. His pursuers, he reasoned, would break into two groups to make sure that they did not lose him. He could make his stand in the church, or even the plantation house, if he just got there ahead of them. He was not a great shot, but from hiding he could certainly handle one or two men coming up the road toward&#x2014;<br><br>The sudden hard burning in his leg, followed by the horse&#x2019;s shriek, told him that bullets were being fired. He heard the fl at clap of the gun as the horse threw him. He hit the frozen earth hard. More shots followed. Just before he passed out, he realized that he had been chased into a trap, forgetting, in his desperation to escape the men behind him, to worry about what might be waiting out front.<br>&nbsp;<br>HE OPENED HIS eyes, and was aware at once that the burning in his leg was worse. He groaned and tried to shift, only to realize that a boot was pressing into the wound. He was propped against a tree, hands bound behind him. Through the haze of pain, he was able to make out a small group of men, all of them hooded. The man with his foot on the wound was thickset, and wore a blue mask. Beside him was a taller and thinner man, head covered by a burlap sack with eyeholes cut into it.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s awake,&#x201d; said the man in blue.<br><br>&#x201c;Course he is,&#x201d; said the man in burlap, &#x201c;seeing as how you&#x2019;re pretty much breaking his leg.&#x201d;<br><br>The heavy man stooped. He was sodden with sweat. &#x201c;Whatcha doin out here, boy? There&#x2019;s a curfew.&#x201d;<br><br>The black man grimaced, and dropped his eyes. &#x201c;Sorry, suh.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Say that again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry, suh.&#x201d;<br><br>The man in the blue mask stood up and walked over to the others. The black man laid his head against the tree, glad to be free of the pain. His eyes were glazed, but his hearing was fine.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like how he sounds,&#x201d; said the man in blue, who seemed to be the leader. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s faking. He&#x2019;s not one of ours. He&#x2019;s one of them Northern niggers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen this boy,&#x201d; said the man in brown burlap. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a Dempsey boy.&#x201d;<br><br>The leader&#x2019;s face was invisible inside the blue hood, but, even so, his posture seemed to communicate disappointment. He leaned close to the prisoner. &#x201c;Is that true, boy? Do you work for Mr. Dempsey?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mrs. Dempsey, suh. Yassuh.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mrs. Claire Dempsey up Warrenton way?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Suh, I don&#x2019;t know a Missus Claire. I works for Missus Henrietta, at Heddon Hills.&#x201d;<br><br>The release of tension was general. Heddon Hills was indeed the Dempsey family plantation: fallen on hard times, to be sure, since the Yankees came through, but still in Dempsey hands. The man in burlap put his hand on the leader&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;Satisfied?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a Dempsey boy, I told you&#x2014; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe he is, maybe he isn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; said the leader. He shook himself free of the other&#x2019;s grip. &#x201c;I say he&#x2019;s educated.&#x201d;<br><br>All five hoods turned his way.<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s an educated nigger,&#x201d; he continued, eyes fairly glowing through the slits. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll &#x2018;Yassuh&#x2019; and &#x2018;Nossuh&#x2019; till Judgment Day, but behind that black face he&#x2019;s laughing at us. He&#x2019;s one of those educated niggers, he&#x2019;s been to some nigger school somewhere, and now he thinks he&#x2019;s better than we are.&#x201d; With a movement of sublime laziness, he tucked the muzzle of his shotgun up against the black man&#x2019;s chin. &#x201c;Is that right, boy? You&#x2019;ve been to some nigger school, haven&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nossuh,&#x201d; said the prisoner, eyes wide in the smooth brown face.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re a Dempsey boy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yassuh.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Search him.&#x201d;<br><br>Immediately the black man felt his bound hands drawn farther behind him. The pain would have doubled him over but for the shotgun pressing into his neck. One of his captors was going through his pockets, and another through his saddlebags. He heard an exclamation and knew they had found his little supply of greenbacks. Another, and he knew they had found the weapons.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a letter,&#x201d; somebody said, and handed it to the thin man who had tried to protect him. He tore open the envelope. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s from Mrs. Dempsey all right. It says this here is Royal, and he&#x2019;s been loyal to her since he was a boy. He never ran off with the Yankees. It says he&#x2019;s carrying a message down to a Mr. Toombs in Snickers Gap.&#x201d; He gave the paper to the leader. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s Mrs. Dempsey&#x2019;s signature. She does some of her banking with me.&#x201d;<br>The leader sneered. &#x201c;And now this boy knows who you are.&#x201d;<br><br>Silence.<br><br>The gun barrel prodded the black man&#x2019;s neck. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the message?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Suh?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What message does Mrs. Dempsey have you sending to Mr. Toombs?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Suh, Mrs. Dempsey wants to invite her goddaughter to spend the holidays at Heddon Hills.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the whole message?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yassuh.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Enough,&#x201d; said the man in burlap. &#x201c;This ain&#x2019;t who we&#x2019;re looking for. Let him go, Bill.&#x201d;<br><br>The leader turned his way. &#x201c;And now he knows who I am, too.&#x201d; He lowered the shotgun and, without warning, pulled the trigger. The black man cried out in agony. Wounded now in both thigh and foot, he collapsed against the tree. <br><br>Bill crouched beside the prisoner. &#x201c;Do you think we&#x2019;re stupid, boy? You think we&#x2019;re illiterate crackers? I was with Jubal Early for two years. I was a colonel. My friend Jedediah here&#x2014;since we&#x2019;re telling names&#x2014;was a captain. He was with Whiting at Fort Fisher. Now, let me tell you something.&#x201d; The gun caressed the wounded man&#x2019;s thigh. &#x201c;I know who you are. I know what you&#x2019;re doing. You are a courier for the Yankee secret service.&#x201d; The black man was shaking his head frantically. &#x201c;You are a courier, and you are carrying a secret message. Tell us the truth, and tell us where the message is hidden, or I&#x2019;ll blow your balls off and let you bleed to death, and meanwhile we&#x2019;ll find the message anyway.&#x201d; The man called Jedediah tugged at his arm. The others were already inching toward their mounts. &#x201c;Come on, Bill. Let&#x2019;s get out of here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Get him up.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Get him up. I want him on his horse.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Because we&#x2019;re gonna have us a hanging.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But&#x2014; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s a spy, Jedediah. Spies get hanged.&#x201d;<br><br>The man in burlap shook his head. &#x201c;The war&#x2019;s over.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not for me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;THE BODY WAS found two days later by a Union patrol. The night riders had left him in a ditch, after stealing his horse, his weapons, and his money. The soldiers made nothing of it. The night riders were killing colored men all over the South, and there was not much to be done about it. There was no way of investigating, even if anybody had wanted to. Nobody talked to the Yankees.<br><br>The soldiers took the corpse up to Winchester and turned it over to the colored Benevolent Association, who would bury the remains somewhere. But before the soldiers surrendered the body, they took the boots, because supplies were still short, and if they didn&#x2019;t fit you, you could always trade with somebody they did. And the boots were passed a good way down the line before somebody found the false lining, and the wad of paper hidden inside. He thought it was money, but it turned out to be just a list of names. The private told his sergeant, who said the dead man was probably in the black market. The names were his customers.<br><br>The sergeant told the private to deliver the paper to the office of the adjutant general, just in case military personnel were involved.

What is&nbsp;<em>worship</em>&nbsp;in the first place? The stark differences in worship styles between churches leads to much confusion. Services with flippant worship cause us to miss the majesty and magnificence of God. On the other hand, stiff-necked worship doesn&#x2019;t recognize that God is actually&nbsp;<em>happy</em>, and that we are called to be happy as well. So what&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;our worship look like? Is there a balance&#x2014;worship that is both solemn&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;joyful?</p> <p>Yes! Gravity in worship doesn&#x2019;t mean being stern or grim. And gladness in worship doesn&#x2019;t mean being frivolous or superficial. If our God is both inestimably glorious and infinitely happy, our worship will have&nbsp;<em>both</em>&nbsp;gravity and gladness, both substance and satisfaction.</p> <p>In this twelve-session seminar, John Piper looks to the Bible to help individuals and churches discover the true nature of worship. Join Piper as he calls Christians to worship God daily with gravity and gladness.</p> <p>This DVD of the seminar and its accompanying study guide are especially designed for Bible studies and community groups.</p></p><p><p><strong>John Piper</strong> (DTheol, University of Munich) is the founder and teacher of desiringGod.org&nbsp;and the chancellor of Bethlehem College &amp; Seminary.

He received his elementary education in the public schools of Lebanon, Pa., then graduated in pharmacy from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and later in medicine from Hahnemann Medical College of Philadelphia. He settled in Parkersburg, W. Va., in 1888 where a long and very large practise was his, patients consulting him from neighboring states and from distant states and countries. His ambition was to devote all his time to teaching and writing but he never reached the point of giving up his practise. However, he frequently lectured before scientific audiences at the Pulte Medical College in Cincinnati and was a teacher of philosophy, materia medica, and repertory study in the American Foundation for Homoeopathy Postgraduate School from 1924 until his death. Boger, who was a german scholar, brought B nninghausen&#39;s Characteristics and Repertory into the English Language in 1905. He was married three times. A daughter of the first marriage died quite young. The second marriage brought him four sons and five daughters. His third wife, Anna M. Boger, was his secretary and constant helper. He died on September 2, 1935, aged 74, from food-poisoning after eating a tin of home-preserved tomatoes. He was a devoted follower of the Boenninghausen method of a repertory study, as all his published works show.</p><h2>The BASEBALL CARD CONSPIRACY (HARDY BOYS 117) (The Hardy Boys)</h2><p>When the Hardys&#39; friend Biff falls victim to a counterfeit baseball-card scheme, Frank and Joe go undercover at a baseball memorabilia convention in New York City.

Outcault&#39;s the Yellow Kid: A Centennial Celebration of the Kid Who Started the Comics</h2><p>The Yellow Kid was the main character in the precursor to today&#39;s comic strips (and is so well-recognized as such that the US Postal Service has issued a centennial commemorative stamp in his honor). This volume reprints the Yellow Kid strips for the first time since their original publication in 1895-98 in their entirety and in their original color. Extensive text by Bill Blackbeard, director of the San Francisco Academy of Comic Art traces the history and sets the context. No index. Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p>A bald, grinning street urchin in an oversized yellow nightshirt, Outcault's Yellow Kid sparked the "first definitive comic strip in history." With extensive text on the antecedents of the Kid (aka Mickey Dugan), historical information and discussion of the artist's evolution, this volume, collecting all of Outcault's Yellow Kid panels and strips, is a must for aficionados of the comics and of turn-of-the-century Americana. Blackbeard, director of the San Francisco Academy of Comic Art, has provided 15 chapters of commentary with details ranging from the origin of the Yellow Kid's baldness (slum-dwelling children often had their heads shaved to combat lice) to the history of the Hearst versus Pulitzer "newspaper wars." Although the Kid was not the inspiration for the phrase "yellow journalism," the character did cause a flood of mass merchandise?dolls, candy, even cigars. The book includes photos (by Jacob Riis and others) of real children who lived in tenements like those inhabited by the Kid and his pals. Since Outcault's characters often commented on conditions and events of the day, much of Blackbeard's background is useful, although the more casual reader may be overwhelmed. His enthusiasm for Outcault (who later created Buster Brown) often gives way to excessive detail and passive prose, not necessary to enjoying the whimsy of the cartoonist's "accidental" and wonderful invention. Color plates plus b&amp;w illustrations. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.This year is the centenary of the comic strip, for 1895 was the year the first strip star, a street urchin in a yellow nightshirt, appeared in the <i>New York World</i>. It wasn't until the following year, however, after artist R. F. Outcault took the character to a rival paper, that the multiple-panel technique was used, inaugurating the comic strip as we know it. Color comic supplements soon became huge selling points for turn-of-the-century newspapers, and the Yellow Kid was their first main attraction. With the onset of the Spanish-American War in 1898, the Kid vanished, apparently done in by public sentiment against the color yellow, the dominant hue in the Spanish flag. The 250 cartoons reproduced here, most in color, are pretty crude by today's standards, but their depiction of New York a century ago is culturally fascinating, and Bill Blackbeard's text tracing the development of the Kid and the birth of the comics is impressively detailed. <i>Gordon Flagg</i></p><h2>Tag Man: A Joe Gunther Novel (Joe Gunther Series)</h2><p><i>"Archer Mayor's Vermont police procedurals are the best thing going..." --</i>New York Times Book Review<br><br>Across Brattleboro, Vermont, rich people (some with dark secrets) are waking up in their high security, alarm-equipped homes to find a Post-it note stuck to their bedside tables reading, "You're it."

Original.</p><p><b>Tony D. Burton</b> has been an active member of the Metro New York chapter of the Make-A-Wish Foundation since 1996.<p> <b>Introduction</b> </p><p> This is not your typical book. It doesn't have main characters, plots, or subplots. Nor are there protagonists confronting antagonists coming to some resolution in a climactic ending. This book is a collection of "favorite things" from the famous and not-so-famous; lists that are as varied as the individuals who wrote them. But if I had to name the one thing the letters do have in common, I could do so with a single word: <i>simplicity.</i> Whether the submission came from a former military general, a movie star, or a young child, all are celebrations of life's simple things. </p><p> Personally, if I were asked to write a submission for this book, I would not know where to end for fear of leaving something out. I would definitely include dinners with good friends and family that go well into the night; weekends at the Castle Hill Inn, in Newport, Rhode Island; the smell of bacon cooking on any morning; a James Taylor concert on a summer night; playing softball in Manhattan's Central Park or Chappaqua, NY; golden retrievers; <i>The New York Times</i> on Sunday; the sound of my goddaughter's voice; and all the ways my wife, Jackie, makes me smile. These are also simple things. </p><p> The idea for <i>These Are a Few of My Favorite Things</i> was born a few years ago when I had the pleasure of working with Bob Costas on a news segment for NBC television. After we worked together, I sent Bob a Christmas gift: a short book honoring Mickey Mantle. Within days, Bob returned a thoughtful note card in which he shared how much he appreciated my sentiment. His letter meant so much to me that I tacked it up on the bulletin board in my office. What amazed me was how my friends and colleagues reacted upon seeing the note. It was not the content they marveled at. Instead, they were fascinated to see his own stationery, his handwriting, and his signature up close and in person. Today, with e-mail, faxes, and telephone being so pervasive, the intimacy provided by a letter has been nearly lost. A handwritten letter has been physically touched, folded, and cared for before it reaches your mailbox. That is what drew my friends to open Bob's note card. </p><p> A portion of the proceeds from this book will be donated directly to the Make-A-Wish Foundation�. As a volunteer for the Foundation, I have experienced firsthand the sense of joy that this organization has bestowed upon others. The selflessness of the workers inspired me to bring greater recognition and financial support to their work through this book. As you share in the warmth of these letters, know that your purchase will help a child's wish come true. It is also my sincere hope that this collection will inspire you to remember your own favorite things. Jot them down and share them with loved ones. </p><p> Tony D.

These are not simply traditional retellings; they include relevant relationships and laws revealed in Judaism's holiest book as well. This attention to the complexity and detail of the Torah means that these books are not always fascinating reading; nor do they supply a rabbinical commentary like that found in Joel L. Grishaver's Torah Toons (Torah Aura, 1985). Unfortunately, the Hebrew name accompanying each Torah portion and the Shema prayer in Deuteronomy are written in Hebrew only, with no English transliteration. Nevertheless, the books succeed in imparting the instructive importance of the weekly Torah reading. Attractive and abundant watercolor illustrations and an uncluttered layout make them even more accessible. Each volume also includes Midrashim (supplemental readings) as well as the "Book of Esther" in Leviticus and "The Book of Jonah" in Deuteronomy.

Dr. Bowler was the founding director of the Centre for the Study of Christianity and Contemporary Culture at Calgary&#x2019;s Nazarene University College. He lives in Winnipeg, Manitoba, with his wife, Karen, and three daughters.This encyclopedia is described as a "truly comprehensive look at Christmas and all its customs" on its book jacket. It provides more than 1,000 entries on worldwide secular and religious Christmas practices expressed in song, literature, events, film, arts, and trivia and is aimed at young adult and adult readers as well as researchers. Entries are primarily descriptive, but a number of them, especially those on films, contain critical commentary.<p>The entries proceed from <i>A</i> to <i>Z</i> with a liberal number of black-and-white illustrations and 16 pages of color plates. An entry heading is in boldface if it is historical or factual; in italics if it is a book, film title, or foreign phrase; and in quotation marks if it is a song or short story title. Cross-references are in capital letters or given as a s<i>ee</i> item. Notable among the entries are <i>Quotes about Christmas, </i> which<i> </i> lists quotations related to the season; a chronology of <i>December 25 events;</i> discussions of films such as <i>A Christmas Carol </i> and <i>It's a Wonderful Life;</i> entries giving the histories as well as the words of individual songs and carols; and descriptions of practices like mumming.</p><p>A serious shortcoming is the lack of a detailed index, which would bring together the various songs, carols, films, etc., that are referred to within the various entries. Lack of a bibliography or list of sources is another weakness, as is the fact that the scope is not explained in the introduction. Some countries have been omitted, including much of Africa, India, Korea, and Turkey. Finally, the illustrations, though they are captioned, lack dates or sources. It is tedious to scroll through the Copyright Holder's page for this information.</p><p>On the positive side, the book is enticing reading with its many descriptions of exotic customs and its blend of the ancient and the modern. It is written well and concisely. Many of the older books on Christmas customs, now out of print or difficult to find, are admirably updated in this new volume, which can enrich high-school, college, and public library collections. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Islamic culture and enterprise stretched from Tunisia to India; its legacy influenced politics and society for years to come. From the founding of the city of Baghdad in A.D. 762 to the end of the ninth century, the rule of the Abbasid dynasty was the zenith of Islamic conquest and influence. The caliphs of Baghdad formed the model for succeeding Muslim regimes, from military conquests to court-sponsored poetry and literature, from building palaces to establishing court bureaucracies. Yet the true story of this fascinating empire has rarely been told outside the academic world.In this deftly woven narrative, Hugh Kennedy introduces us to the rich history and flourishing culture of the period and to the men and women of the palaces at Baghdad and Samarra the caliphs, viziers, eunuchs, and women of the harem who fashioned the glorious days of the <i>Arabian Nights</i> . It is an epic story in every sense, with larger-than-life rulers, exotic slave girls, inventive tortures, and enough court intrigue to frighten a Borgia.</p><p><b>Hugh Kennedy</b> has taught in the Department of Mediaeval History at the University of St. Andrews since 1972. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 2000. Professor Kennedy lives in St. Andrews, Scotland.<i>Starred Review.</i> These days Baghdad is associated with violence and insurgency. But more than a thousand years ago, during the Abbasid caliphate, Baghdad was a center of the arts and sciences, a city of dreams and limitless opportunities. This eminently entertaining book by respected British historian Kennedy focuses on these glory days of Baghdad in the eighth and ninth centuries, and the city's eventual downfall. Firmly grounded in the original Arabic literary sources of the era, Kennedy (<i>Mongols, Huns and Vikings</i>) emphasizes the amazing personalities of the period, such as Caliph Harun al-Rashid (mythologized in <i>The</i><i>Arabian Nights</i>) and his powerful queen Zubayda. Kennedy's account is not a dry political chronicle but rather full of stories of love, sex, power, corruption, sibling rivalry and political intrigue&#x2014;for which he makes no apology. Kennedy does a superb job resurrecting the human dimension of the period, as in apt descriptions of life in Harun al-Rashid's harem or the various caliphs' decisions whether or not to wage war. He also provides a sophisticated account of the general cultural and political climate based on recent scholarship. Combining academic rigor and accessibility, this is compelling reading for anyone concerned with the perils of power, the medieval Islamic legacy and the images that Baghdad continues to conjure in the modern imagination. 24 pages of illus., 3 maps. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

MacDonald (1916-1986) MacDonald was born in Sharon, Pa, and educated at the Universities of Pennsylvania, Syracuse and Harvard, where he took an MBA in 1939. After war service in the Far East he wrote hundreds of stories for the pulps and over seventy novels, including the 21 in the Travis McGee sequence.One<br> On the most beautiful day any April could be asked to come up with, I was kneeling in eight inches of oily water in the cramped bilge of Meyer&#x2019;s squatty little cabin cruiser, the <i>John Maynard Keynes,</i> taking his automatic bilge pump apart for the third time in an hour.<br> The socket wrench slipped, and I skinned yet another knuckle. Meyer stood blocking out a sizable piece of the deep blue sky. He stared down into the bilge and said, &#x201c;Very inventive and very fluent. Nice mental images, Travis. Imagine one frail little bilge pump performing such an extraordinary act upon itself! But you began to repeat yourself toward the end.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Would you like to crawl down in here and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> He backed up a hasty half step. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t deprive you of the pleasure. You said you could fix it. Go ahead.&#x201d;<br> I got it apart again. I spun the little impeller blade and suddenly realized that maybe it turned too freely. Found the set screw would take a full turn. Tightened it back down onto the shaft. Reassembled the crummy little monster, bolted it down underwater, heaved myself up out of the water, sat on the edge of the hatch, and had Meyer flip the switch. It started to make a nice steady wheeeeeeng, gouting dirty bilge water into the Bahia Mar yacht basin.<br> Meyer started to applaud, and I told him to save it until we found out if the adorable thing would turn itself the hell off like it says in the fine print. It took a good ten minutes to pump the water out. Then it went weeeeeeng-guggle-chud. Silence.<br> &#x201c;Now cheer,&#x201d; I said.<br> &#x201c;Hooray,&#x201d; he said mildly. &#x201c;Thank you very much and hooray.&#x201d; I looked at him with exasperation and affection. My mild and bulky friend with the wise little blue eyes, bright and bemused, and with the bear hair, thatch black, curling out of the throat of his blue knit shirt.<br> &#x201c;Another half inch of rain last night,&#x201d; I told him, &#x201c;and you could have gone down like a stone.&#x201d;<br> He had stepped out of his bunk in the dark after the rain stopped and into ankle deep water. He had sloshed over to my houseboat, the <i>Busted Flush,</i> and told me he had a small problem. At three in the morning we had toted my auxiliary pump over and set it on the dock and dropped the intake hose into his bilge. His home and refuge was very low in the water, the mooring lines taut enough to hum when plucked. By first light the <i>Keynes</i> was floating high again, and we could turn the pump off and carry it back. Now the repaired automatic bilge pump had taken out the last of the water, but he was going to live in dampness for quite a while.<br> &#x201c;Perils of the sea,&#x201d; he said.<br> I stepped up onto the dock and squatted and began to rinse the grease and bilge water off my hands under the hose faucet. Meyer shaded his eyes and looked toward the <i>Flush</i>. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got a visitor, Travis. Isn&#x2019;t that what&#x2019;s-his-name?&#x201d;<br> I stood up and stared. &#x201c;It sure is. Good old what&#x2019;s-his-name. Harry Broll. Do you think that son of a bitch has come to try me again?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;After the showing last time . . . Was it two years ago?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;At least.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I think he&#x2019;s at least bright enough not to try again.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Not the same way. But he did catch me with one very nice left. True, he broke his hand, but it was one to re�member.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Want company?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No thanks.&#x201d;<br> Harry turned and saw me when I was about fifty feet away. He was big, and he had gotten bigger since I&#x2019;d seen him last. More gut and more jowls. Not becoming. He wore a pale beige suit, a yellow shirt, and he had a chocolate-�colored neckerchief with an ornate, gold slip ring.<br> He raised his hands in the most primitive gesture of reassurance. Palms out. Sickly smile to go with it. As I came up to him he said, &#x201c;Hi, McGee.&#x201d; He put his hand out. I looked at it until he pulled it back. He tried to laugh. &#x201c;Jesus, are you still sore?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sore, Harry. Why should we shake hands?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Look. I want to talk to you. Are you busy or anything?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What about?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;About Mary. I know you&#x2019;ve got no reason in the world to do me any favors. But this concerns . . . Mary&#x2019;s well-�being.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Is something wrong with her?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. I don&#x2019;t really know.&#x201d;<br> I studied him. He seemed concerned and upset. He had the pallor of desk work. His black hair had receded since I had seen him last. He said, &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t think of anybody else to come to. I can say please if it&#x2019;ll help. Please?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Come on aboard.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Thanks. Thanks a lot.&#x201d;<br> We went into the lounge. I had on an old pair of denim shorts and nothing else. The air-conditioning cooled the sweat on my shoulders and chest. He looked around, nodding and beaming, and said, &#x201c;Nice. Real nice. A nice way to live, huh?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Want a drink?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Bourbon, if you&#x2019;ve got it.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Got it.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;On the rocks.&#x201d;<br> I put out the bottle and the glass and said, glancing down at my soiled hands, &#x201c;Ice is in the bin there. Help yourself while I clean up, Broll.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Thanks. You sure keep yourself in shape, McGee. Wish I had the time. I guess I better make sure I have the time one of these days.&#x201d;<br> I shrugged and went forward, dropped the shorts into the hamper and stepped into the oversized shower, thinking about Mary and wondering about her as I sudsed and scrubbed away the rest of the grime from the repair job. Miss Mary Dillon when I had known her. Then abruptly&#x2014;maybe too abruptly&#x2014;Mrs. Harry Broll. When I put my watch back on I saw that it was nearly four o&#x2019;clock. Meyer and I were invited for drinks at six aboard the <i>Jilly III</i>. I put on fresh slacks, an oyster-white sailcloth sports shirt, my ancient Mexican sandals. On the way back to the lounge I stopped in the galley and put some Plymouth on the rocks.<br> He was sitting on the yellow couch, and he had lit a small&nbsp;cigar with a white plastic mouthpiece. &#x201c;It must really be something, being able to just take off any time you feel like it.&#x201d;<br> I slouched into a chair facing him, took a swallow of my drink, and put it on the coffee table. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got a problem, Harry?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;About that time I made such a damn fool of myself . . .&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Forget it.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No. Please. Let me say something about that. Like they say, the first year of marriage is the hardest, right?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;So they say.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Well, I knew you and Mary were old friends. I couldn&#x2019;t help knowing that, right? I mean, you and Meyer came to the wedding and all. I wondered how good friends you had been. I couldn&#x2019;t help wondering, but I didn&#x2019;t want to really know. Do you understand?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;The way it happened, we got into a hassle. It was the first real one we&#x2019;d had. People shouldn&#x2019;t drink and fight when they&#x2019;re married. They say things they don&#x2019;t want to say. I started saying some pretty ugly things about her and you. You know Mary. She&#x2019;s got a lot of spirit. She took it and took it, and finally she let me have it right between the eyes. I deserved it. She blazed right up at me. She said she&#x2019;d been cruising with you alone aboard this houseboat, down through the Keys and up the west coast to Tampa Bay, and she&#x2019;d lived aboard for a month and cooked your food and washed your clothes and slept in your bed, and you were kind and decent and gentle and twice the man I am. So that Sunday afternoon I slammed out of the house and got in the car and came over here to beat on you. I could always handle myself pretty good. I wasn&#x2019;t drunk enough for that to be any excuse. Jesus, I never hit so many arms and elbows and shoulders in my life.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;And the top of my head.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s what popped the knuckles. Look. This knuckle is still sort of sunk in. How many times did you hit me? Do you know?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Sure I know. Twice.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Twice,&#x201d; he said dolefully. &#x201c;Oh, shit.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I waited until you ran out of steam, Harry. I waited until you got arm weary.&#x201d;<br> He looked at me in an appraising way. &#x201c;I wish I&#x2019;d done more good.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I had a pair of sore arms. You bruised me up, Harry. And a three-day headache.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I guess I had to get it out of my system. Do you understand it&#x2019;s still pretty hard for me to come to you to ask for anything?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I suppose it might be.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Mary kept telling me to grow up. Okay. I&#x2019;m trying to grow up. I&#x2019;m trying to be a mature, rational human being. Like they say, I&#x2019;ve been examining my priorities and my �options.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Good for you. But where do I fit in?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Here&#x2019;s what I want you to tell Mary.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;But I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Give me a chance. Okay? Tell her that as soon as the SeaGate project is all set up, I think we ought to get away, just the two of us. A cruise or fly over to Spain, whatever. And tell her that the Canadian girl didn&#x2019;t mean a damn thing to me, that I didn&#x2019;t bring her back down here or ask her down, that she came on her own. And tell her to please get in touch with me so we can talk.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Hold it! I don&#x2019;t know where Mary is.&#x201d;<br> His face turned red. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t give me such crap. You willing to let me search this houseboat?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;She isn&#x2019;t here, you damn fool.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll find something of hers. Clothes, lipstick, something.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Harry. Jesus. Look around all you want.&#x201d;<br> He settled back in the chair. &#x201c;Okay. You and Mary knew I&#x2019;d come here sooner or later. So you haven&#x2019;t been having your fun aboard this boat.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;That&#x2019;s called paranoia, old buddy. When did she leave you?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;January fifth.&#x201d;<br> I stared at him in disbelief. &#x201c;This is the fourteenth day of April. You have a slow reaction time.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been hoping she&#x2019;d come back or get in touch. Tell her how much I&#x2019;ve been hoping. She caught me dead to rights. She went around the house with a face like a stone for nearly two weeks, then when I got home that Tuesday, she&#x2019;d packed and left. No note, even. I went down the list of her friends and called them. It was humiliating for me.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I bet.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Now just one damn minute&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What makes you think she&#x2019;d come to me?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I thought about it. I mean, back in January. It seemed like the most likely thing for her to do. I spent a whole weekend hanging around here. You had . . . another friend. So I decided if Mary had come here, she&#x2019;d found you were busy, gone someplace else.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;She didn&#x2019;t come here, Harry.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Not right away.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;What is that supposed to mean?&#x201d;<br> He leaned forward. &#x201c;Okay. Where were you at ten o&#x2019;clock on Friday morning, April second?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t the faintest idea.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You and Mary came off this houseboat at ten that morning, and you went out to the parking lot and got into a white Ford LTD convertible with rental plates. A friend of mine happened to be here and happened to see the two of you get in and drive off. This friend followed you. You went over to the Parkway and turned south toward Miami, and he came back, and he phoned me about it.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Are you willing to listen a minute? Are you willing to try to listen?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;All I know is my wife left me and she&#x2019;s sleeping with you, McGee, and I&#x2019;d like to see you dead.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;The woman I was with is about Mary&#x2019;s height, and her figure is just as good, at least as good as Mary&#x2019;s used to be. Her hair is dark like Mary&#x2019;s. The woman is an old friend. That&#x2019;s her rental convertible, and it&#x2019;s still out there on the lot. With her hair in a scarf and dark glasses, she was all prepared for a trip in an open car. She&#x2019;s here aboard her boat. Her name is Jillian Brent-Archer. I haven&#x2019;t seen Mary since the wedding. Not once, Broll. And that was better than three years ago.&#x201d;<br> He looked at me. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re real cute, McGee. Jesus, you&#x2019;re cute. Most of the damn fools in this world would believe you. Are you going to tell Mary what I told you to tell her, what I&#x2019;ve begged you to tell her?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;How can I, when I don&#x2019;t even know . . .&#x201d;<br> And the dumb little weapon came out from under his clothes somewhere, maybe from the waist area, wedged between the belt and the flab. A dumb little automatic pistol in blued steel, half-swallowed in his big, pale, meaty fist. His staring eyes were wet with tears, and his mouth was twisted downward at the corners. The muzzle was making a ragged little circle, and a remote part of my mind identified it as .25 or .32 caliber, there not being all that much difference between a quarter of an inch diameter and a third of an inch. There was a sour laugh back in another compartment of my skull. This could very possibly be the end of it, a long-odds chance of a mortal wound at the hand of a jealous husband wielding something just a little bit better than a cap gun. The ragged circle took in my heart, brain, and certain essential viscera. And I was slouched deep in a chair facing him, just a little too far away to try to kick his wrist. He was going to talk or shoot. I saw his finger getting whiter, so I knew it was shoot.<br> I shoved with my heels and went over backward in the chair. The weapon made a noise like somebody slapping shingles together. My left heel went numb. I rolled to my right, knocked over a small table, fielded the chunky glass ashtray on the first bounce, rolled up onto my knees, and slung it underhand at his head as he came up out of the depths of the yellow couch. I missed him shamefully, and was caught there too close to him as he aimed at the middle of my face from five feet away and tried to pull the trigger. But the slide was all the way back, the clip empty.<br> I got slowly up onto very wobbly knees as Harry Broll lowered the gun to his side, relaxed his hand, let it fall. My heel tingled. A slug had grooved the hard leather on the bottom of the heel. The lounge smelled like the Fourth of July.<br> Harry&#x2019;s big face wrinkled like a slapped baby, and he took a half step toward me, arms half reaching out for comfort and forgiveness, and then he plumped back down on the couch and bellowed once, a walrus on a lonely strand.<br> My drink was gone, spilling when the table went over. I moved cautiously, checking myself for any area that might feel dead and damp. That is the bullet feel, dead, damp, and strange, before the torn nerves and muscles catch up and begin screaming. No such areas. I made tall careful steps into the galley, made a new drink. I went back in. Harry Broll sat with face in hands, snuffling drearily. The paper had kept me aware of him over the years. Broll plans new condominium complex. Broll given zoning board exception. Broll unveils shopping plaza concept. Chamber lauds Broll.<br> I sat opposite him again after putting the chair back on its legs. Looking around, I could count five ejected cartridge cases.<br> &#x201c;How old are you, Harry?&#x201d;<br> He sighed and mumbled it into his hands. &#x201c;Thirty-five.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You look fifty.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Get off my back.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too soft and too heavy. You sweat a lot, and you&#x2019;re short of breath, and your teeth need cleaning.&#x201d;<br> He lifted his mottled face and stared at me. &#x201c;Why are you saying these things?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Maybe if you hadn&#x2019;t gotten so sloppy, Mary could have given you a second chance. Or maybe it was already a second chance.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Oh, no. I don&#x2019;t play around. Jesus, I haven&#x2019;t had the time or the energy. This was the first time, I swear.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t play around, and you don&#x2019;t go around killing people.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You pushed me too far and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You always carry that thing?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No, I&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You brought it along in case you felt like killing me?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Thank God, I missed you. I&#x2019;m not thinking right lately. Everything would have gone down the drain. Everything.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;It would sort of spoil my day, too.&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;You know, when a man takes a good look at himself, he begins to wonder why. You know? I&#x2019;ve been pushing myself hard. ...</p><h2>To Your Scattered Bodies Go</h2><p>All those who ever lived on Earth have found themselves resurrected--healthy, young, and naked as newborns--on the grassy banks of a mighty river, in a world unknown. Miraculously provided with food, but with no clues to the meaning of their strange new afterlife, billions of people from every period of Earth's history--and prehistory--must start again.<br><br>Sir Richard Francis Burton would be the first to glimpse the incredible way-station, a link between worlds. This forbidden sight would spur the renowned 19th-century explorer to uncover the truth. Along with a remarkable group of compatriots, including Alice Liddell Hargreaves (the Victorian girl who was the inspiration for Alice in Wonderland), an English-speaking Neanderthal, a WWII Holocaust survivor, and a wise extraterrestrial, Burton sets sail on the magnificent river. His mission: to confront humankind's mysterious benefactors, and learn the true purpose--innocent or evil--of the Riverworld . . .</p><p><i>To Your Scattered Bodies Go</i> is the Hugo Award-winning beginning to the story of Riverworld, Philip Jos� Farmer's unequaled tale about life after death. When famous adventurer Sir Richard Francis Burton dies, the last thing he expects to do is awaken naked on a foreign planet along the shores of a seemingly endless river. But that's where Burton and billions of other humans (plus a few nonhumans) find themselves as the epic Riverworld saga begins. It seems that all of Earthly humanity has been resurrected on the planet, each with an indestructible container that provides three meals a day, cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, a lighter, and the odd tube of lipstick. But why? And by whom?<p> That's what Burton and a handful of fellow adventurers are determined to discover as they construct a boat and set out in search of the river's source, thought to be millions of miles away. Although there are many hardships during the journey--including an encounter with the infamous Hermann Goring--Burton's resolve to complete his quest is strengthened by a visit from the Mysterious Stranger, a being who claims to be a renegade within the very group that created the Riverworld. The stranger tells Burton that he must make it to the river's headwaters, along with a dozen others the Stranger has selected, to help stop an evil experiment at the end of which humanity will simply be allowed to die. <i>--Craig E.

(The Editors <i>Lambda Literary</i>)<br><br>What claims our attention is not so much Gober's quotidian subjects as the intentness with which he reconstitutes ordinary objects; this is his way of possessing them. Gober's laconic perfectionism lends humdrum stuff an eeriness. I feel that eeriness in teh subtle shadow play he reveals in his plainly carpentered cloest, in the delicacy of human hairs inserted into the wax surface of a sculpted leg, and in the trompe l'oeil finesse with which he paints the label on the battered Benjamin Moore can. Gober keeps his virtuosity tamped down adn under wraps. His weird world is constructed with teh meticulousness of a jeweler putting together a Faberge egg.

It provided scores of soldiers and great quantities of raw materials and helped present a seemingly impregnable global defense against the Axis. Yet, within a few weeks in 1941-42, a Japanese invasion had destroyed all this, sweeping suddenly and decisively through south and southeast Asia to the Indian frontier, and provoking the extraordinary revolutionary struggles which would mark the beginning of the end of British dominion in the East and the rise of today's Asian world.</p><p>More than a military history, this gripping account of groundbreaking battles and guerrilla campaigns creates a panoramic view of British Asia as it was ravaged by warfare, nationalist insurgency, disease, and famine. It breathes life into the armies of soldiers, civilians, laborers, businessmen, comfort women, doctors, and nurses who confronted the daily brutalities of a combat zone which extended from metropolitan cities to remote jungles, from tropical plantations to the Himalayas.

Before that, he had a long career, starring in such films as the Terminator series; <i>Stay Hungry</i>; <i>Twins</i>; <i>Predator</i>; and <i>Junior</i>. His first book, <i>Arnold: The Education of a Bodybuilder</i>, was a bestseller when published in 1977 and, along with his <i>Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding</i>, has never been out of print since.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br>"Arnold! Arnold!"<br><br>I can still hear them, the voices of my friends, the lifeguards, bodybuilders, the weight lifters, booming up from the lake where they were working out in the grass and trees.<br><br>"Arnold -- come on!" cried Karl, the young doctor who had become my friend at the gym...<br><br>It was the summer I turned fifteen, a magical season for me because that year I'd discovered exactly what I wanted to do with my life. It was more than a young boy's mere pipe dream of a distant, hazy future -- confused fantasies of being a fireman, detective, sailor, test pilot, or spy. I <i>knew</i> I was going to be a bodybuilder. It wasn't simply that either. I would be the best bodybuilder in the world, the greatest, the best-built man.<br><br>I'm not exactly sure why I chose bodybuilding, except that I loved it. I loved it from the first moment my fingers closed around a barbell and I felt the challenge and exhilaration of hoisting the heavy steel plates above my head.<br><br>I had always been involved in sports through my father, a tall, sturdy man who was himself a champion at ice curling. We were a physical family, oriented toward training, good eating, and keeping the body fit and healthy. With my father's encouragement, I first got into organized competitive sports when I was ten. I joined a soccer team that even had uniforms and a regular three-days-a-week training schedule. I threw myself into it and played soccer passionately for almost five years.<br><br>However, by the time I was thirteen team sports no longer satisfied me. I was already off on an individual trip. I disliked it when we won a game and I didn't get personal recognition. The only time I really felt rewarded was when I was singled out as being best. I decided to try some individual sports. I ran, I swam, I boxed; I got into competition, throwing javelin and shot put. Although I did well with them, none of those things felt right to me. Then our coach decided that lifting weights for an hour once a week would be a good way to condition us for playing soccer.<br><br>I still remember that first visit to the bodybuilding gym. I had never seen anyone lifting weights before. Those guys were huge and brutal. I found myself walking around them, staring at muscles I couldn't even name, muscles I'd never even seen before. The weight lifters shone with sweat; they were powerful looking, Herculean. And there it was before me -- my life, the answer I'd been seeking. It clicked. It was something I suddenly just seemed to reach out and find, as if I'd been crossing a suspended bridge and finally stepped off onto solid ground.<br><br>I started lifting weights just for my legs, which was what we needed most for playing soccer. The bodybuilders noticed immediately how hard I was working out. Considering my age, fifteen, I was squatting with some pretty heavy weight. They encouraged me to go into bodybuilding. I was 6 feet tall and slender, weighing only 150 pounds; but I did have a good athletic physique and my muscles responded surprisingly fast under training. I think those guys saw that. Because of my build I'd always had it easier at sports than most boys my age. But I had it tougher than a lot of my teammates and companions because I wanted more, I demanded more of myself.<br><br>That summer the bodybuilders took me on as their prot�g�. They put me through a series of exercises, which we did together beside a lake near Graz, my hometown in Austria. It was a program they used simply to stay limber. We worked without weights. We did chin-ups on the branches of trees. We held each other's legs and did handstand push-ups. Leg raises, sit-ups, twists, and squats were all included in a simple routine to get our bodies tuned and ready for the gym.<br><br>It wasn't until the end of the summer that I got into real weight training. Once I started, though, it didn't take long. After two or three months with the bodybuilders, I was literally addicted. The guys I hung out with were all much older. Karl Gerstl, the doctor, was twenty-eight, Kurt Manul thirty-two, and Helmut Knaur was fifty. Each of them became a father image for me. I listened less to my own father. These weight lifters were my new heroes. I was in awe of them, of their size, of the control they had over their bodies.<br><br>I was introduced to actual weight training through a tough basic program put together by these bodybuilders. The one hour a week we had trained for soccer was no longer enough to satisfy my craving for working out. I signed up to go to the gym three times a week. I loved the feel of the cold iron and steel warming to my touch and the sounds and smells of the gym. And I still love it. There is nothing I would sooner hear than the sound of heavy steel plates ringing as they are threaded onto the bar or dropped back to the rack after a strenuous lift.<br><br>I remember the first real workout I had as vividly as if it were last night. I rode my bike to the gym, which was eight miles from the village where I lived. I used barbells, dumbbells and machines. The guys warned me that I'd get sore, but it didn't seem to be having any effect. I thought I must be beyond that. Then, after the workout, I started riding home and fell off my bike. I was so weak I couldn't make my hands hold on. I had no feeling in my legs: they were noodles. I was numb, my whole body buzzing. I pushed the bike for a while, leaning on it. Half a mile farther, I tried to ride it again, fell off again, and then just pushed it the rest of the way home. This was my first experience with weight training, and I was crazy for it.<br><br>The next morning I couldn't even lift my arm to comb my hair. Each time I tried, pain shot through every muscle in my shoulder and arm. I couldn't hold the comb. I tried to drink coffee and spilled it all over the table. I was helpless.<br><br>"What's wrong, Arnold?" my mother asked. She came over from the stove and peered at me. "What is it?" She bent down to look closer as she mopped up the spilled coffee.<br><br>"I'm just sore," I told her. "My muscles are stiff."<br><br>"Look at this boy!" she called out to my father. "Look what he's doing to himself."<br><br>My father came in, doing up his tie. He was always neat, his hair slicked back smooth, his mustache trimmed to a line. He laughed and said I'd limber up.<br><br>But my mother kept on. "Why, Arnold? Why do you want to do it to yourself?"<br><br>I couldn't be bothered with what my mother felt. Seeing new changes in my body, feeling them, turned me on. It was the first time I'd ever felt every one of my muscles. It was the first time those sensations had registered in my mind, the first time my mind knew my thighs, calves and forearms were more than just limbs. I felt the muscles in my triceps aching, and I knew why they were called triceps -- because there are three muscles in there. They were all registered in my mind, written there with sharp little jabs of pain. I learned that this pain meant progress. Each time my muscles were sore from a workout, I knew they were growing.<br><br>I could not have chosen a less popular sport. My school friends thought I was crazy. But I didn't care. My only thoughts were of going ahead, building muscles and more muscles. I had almost no time to relax and think about bodybuilding in any other terms. I remember certain people trying to put negative thoughts into my mind, trying to persuade me to slow down. But I had found the thing to which I wanted to devote my total energies and there was no stopping me. My drive was unusual, I talked differently than my friends; I was hungrier for success than anyone I knew.<br><br>I started to live for being in the gym. I had a new language -- reps, sets, forced reps, presses. I had resisted memorizing anatomy in school; now I was eager to know it. Around the gym my new friends spoke of biceps, triceps, latissimus dorsi, trapezius, obliques. I spent hours going through the American magazines <i>Muscle Builder</i> and <i>Mr. America.</i> Karl, the doctor, knew English and I had him translating anytime he was free. I saw my first photographs of Muscle Beach; I saw Larry Scott, Ray Routledge, and Serge Nubret. The magazines were full of success stories. The advantages of having a well-developed body were incomparable. Guys like Doug Stroll and Steve Reeves were in the movies because they had worked out and created great physiques.<br><br>In one of those magazines I saw my first photograph of Reg Park. He was on a page facing Jack Delinger. I responded immediately to Reg Park's rough, massive look. The man was an animal. That's the way I wanted to be -- ultimately: big. I wanted to be a big guy. I didn't want to be delicate. I dreamed of big deltoids, big pecs, big thighs, big calves; I wanted every muscle to explode and be huge. I dreamed about being gigantic. Reg Park was the epitome of that dream, the biggest, most powerful person in bodybuilding.<br><br>From then on in my mid-teens, I kept my batteries charged with the adventure movies of Steve Reeves, Mark Forrest, Brad Harris, Gordon Mitchell, and Reg Park. I admired Reg Park more than the others. He was rugged, everything I thought a man should be. I recall seeing him for the first time on the screen. The film was <i>Hercules and the Vampires,</i> a picture in which the hero had to rid the earth of an invasion of thousands of bloodthirsty vampires. Reg Park looked so magnificent in the role of Hercules I was transfixed. And, sitting there in the theater, I knew that was going to be me. I would look like Reg Park. I studied every move he made, every gesture....Suddenly I realized the house lights were on and everyone else had walked out.<br><br>From that point on, my life was utterly dominated by Reg Park. His image was my ideal. It was fixed indelibly in my mind. All my friends were more impressed by Steve Reeves, but I didn't like him. Reg Park had more of a rough look, a powerful look, while Steve Reeves seemed elegant, smooth, polished. I knew in my mind that I was not geared for elegance. I wanted to be massive. It was the difference between cologne and sweat.<br><br>I found out everything I could about Reg Park. I bought all the magazines that published his programs. I learned how he started training, what he ate, how he lived, and how he did his workouts. I became obsessed with Reg Park; he was the image in front of me from the time I started training. The more I focused in on this image and worked and grew, the more I saw it was real and possible for me to be like him. Even Karl and Kurt could see it. They predicted that it would happen within five years.<br><br>But I didn't think I could wait five years. I had this insatiable drive to get there sooner. Whereas most people were satisfied to train two or three times a week, I quickly escalated my program to six workouts a week.<br><br>My father was baffled by my eagerness. "Don't do it, Arnold," he said. "You'll overtrain, you'll overwork yourself."<br><br>"I'm all right," I said. "I'm doing it gradually."<br><br>"Yes," he said. "But what will you do with all these muscles once you've got them?"<br><br>"I want to be the best-built man in the world," I said frankly.<br><br>That made him sigh and shake his head.<br><br>"Then I want to go to America and be in movies. I want to be an actor."<br><br>"America?"<br><br>"Yes -- America."<br><br>"My god!" he cried. He went into the kitchen and told my mother, "I think we better go to the doctor with this one, he's sick in the head."<br><br>He was genuinely worried about me. He felt I wasn't normal. And of course he was right. With my desire and my drive, I definitely wasn't normal. Normal people can be happy with a regular life. I was different. I felt there was more to life than just plodding through an average existence. I'd always been impressed by stories of greatness and power. Caesar, Charlemagne, Napoleon were names I knew and remembered. I wanted to do something special, to be recognized as the best. I saw bodybuilding as the vehicle that would take me to the top, and I put all my energy into it.<br><br>Six days a week, I trained, constantly working to increase the amount of weight I could handle and the length of time I could stay in the gym. I had this fixed idea of building a body like Reg Park's. The model was there in my mind; I only had to grow enough to fill it. My dreams went beyond a spectacular body. Once I had that, I knew what it would do for me. I'd get into the movies and build gymnasiums all over the world. I'd create an empire.<br><br>Reg Park became my father image. I pasted his pictures on all the walls of my bedroom. I read everything about him that was printed in German; I had Karl translate the English stories for me. I studied every photograph of him I could get my hands on -- noting the size of his chest, arms, thighs, back and abdominals. This inspired me to work even harder. When I felt my lungs burning as though they would burst and my veins bulging with blood, I loved it. I knew then that I was growing, making one more step toward becoming like Reg Park. I wanted that body and I didn't care what I had to go through to get it.<br><br>That winter my father informed me I could only go to the gym three times a week -- he didn't want me away from home every evening. To get around his curfew, I put together a gymnasium at home.<br><br>The house we lived in was three hundred years old. It had been built originally by part of the Royal family. Upon moving out years before, they had stipulated that two people should inhabit the house: the Chief of Police for the area around Graz, a position my father held at that time, and the ranger in charge of all forests in the vicinity. For a hundred years it had been the custom for these two people to stay there. Our family lived upstairs and the forest ranger had the downstairs.<br><br>The house was built like a castle. The floors were solid and the walls were about five feet thick. It was a good place to have a gymnasium. The walls and floor could take the punishment of heavy weight. I had the basic equipment, such as benches and simple machines, designed and welded for me. My weight room was not heated, so naturally in cold weather it was freezing. I didn't care. I trained without heat, even on days when the temperature went below zero.<br><br>Three nights a week I went to the gym in town. I either had to walk or ride my bike eight miles home after ten o'clock. I didn't really mind the eight miles. I knew it was helping my body, increasing the strength of my legs and lungs.<br><br>The only real problem I had with training at home was to get someone to work out with me. Already, since my experiences at the lake, I was a strong believer in training partners. I needed someone not only to teach me but to inspire me. I trained better, harder, if I was around someone whose enthusiasm was as strong as mine and who would be impressed by my enthusiasm. That first winter, I trained with Karl Gerstl, the doctor who had helped me with my initial program. Aside from his usefulness as a translator, it was especially helpful to be around Karl. He knew everything about the body. He was serious and worked hard. We trained the same way, except our goals and our diets were different: I wanted to gain weight, to bulk up; Karl wanted to lose it. But Karl gave me the boost I needed.<br><br>There were certain days when something held me back and I didn't train as hard as on other days. That was inexplicable to me. Some days nothing could hold me back. Other days I'd be down. On the down days I couldn't handle anywhere near my normal amount of weight. It puzzled me. Karl and I discussed it. He had read a great deal of psychology (at fifteen I barely knew the word, though his argument made good sense and in fact helped lay the foundation for my later thinking). "It's not your body, Arnold. Your body can't change ...</p><h2>You&#39;re Welcome, Universe</h2><p><b>A vibrant, edgy, fresh new YA voice for fans of <i>More Happy Than Not</i> and <i>Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda,</i> packed with interior graffiti.<br><br>Winner of the Schneider Family Book Award!</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> When Julia finds a slur about her best friend scrawled across the back of the Kingston School for the Deaf, she covers it up with a beautiful (albeit illegal) graffiti mural.<br> &nbsp;<br> Her supposed best friend snitches, the principal expels her, and her two mothers set Julia up with a one-way ticket to a &#x201c;mainstream&#x201d; school in the suburbs, where she&#x2019;s treated like an outcast as the only deaf student.

But Julia soon learns that she might not be the only vandal in town. Someone is adding to her tags, making them better, showing off&#x2014;and showing Julia up in the process. She expected her art might get painted over by cops. But she never imagined getting dragged into a full-blown graffiti war. <br> &nbsp;<br> Told with wit and grit by debut author Whitney Gardner, who also provides gorgeous interior illustrations of Julia&#x2019;s graffiti tags, <i>You&#x2019;re Welcome, Universe</i> introduces audiences to a one-of-a-kind protagonist who is unabashedly herself no matter what life throws in her way. <br><br>"[A] spectacular debut...a moving, beautifully written contemporary novel full of quirky art and complicated friendships...this book is a gift to be thankful for."&#x2014;<i>BookRiot</i></p><p>WHITNEY GARDNER played her ukulele in an episode of Portlandia, danced the rumba with Bill Nye the Science Guy in a New York swing-dance club, and experimented with LARPing in college.

You&#x2019;ll only make it worse.&#x201d; His hands are big, with stubby fingers. He might be hearing, but he signs perfectly. He has to, or he never would have gotten the job.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not lying! You can&#x2019;t say it was me.&#x201d; I know there are no cameras on that side of Kingston. I know there won&#x2019;t be any footage to review.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I have all the proof I need. Look at your hands!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I&#x2019;m so stupid. I was being lazy. I&#x2019;m going to need to buy gloves. Lots and lots of gloves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;This was from art class.&#x201d; I sign as fast as I can before dropping my hands out of view and into my lap.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to give you one more chance to tell the truth, Miss Prasad.&#x201d; Mr. Howard seems more agitated than angry. He keeps sighing, looking at me with droopy, tired eyes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what to tell you. Sorry.&#x201d; Let me go already, you&#x2019;ve got nothing. He stares at me, waiting for a better answer. I&#x2019;m not giving it to him. I&#x2019;m not confessing to anything, as much as I want to take credit for it. He hangs his head and pinches the bridge of his nose.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, what can you tell me about this?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My heart shakes up in my chest like a paint can as he produces a cell phone from his desk drawer, the case dotted with red cherries. It&#x2019;s Jordyn&#x2019;s. He slides it across the desk like some detective on Law &amp; Order.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t want to look. I don&#x2019;t need to. I know what&#x2019;s about to happen. And I know without looking that Jordyn, my best friend in the universe, sold me out. How could she?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;The paint on your hands, the picture on her phone. You can&#x2019;t tell me you didn&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Fine. But I was covering up--&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not your job.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, whose job is it? Because that nasty graffiti was up there forever.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Not your job. We had someone scheduled to take care of it.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;But mine is art!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not art, it&#x2019;s vandalism. I&#x2019;m worried about you; you&#x2019;re not exactly showing any remorse here,&#x201d; he lectures. My face flushes hot with rage. He&#x2019;s not worried about me, he&#x2019;s relieved he has someone to pin it on. I wonder if the slut-shaming toy-tagger got the fifth degree, too. I doubt it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand what the big deal is! I didn&#x2019;t hurt anyone. I didn&#x2019;t destroy anything. I&#x2019;ve tagged the girls&#x2019; room dozens of times. No one cared then--&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You what?!&#x201d; His face is turning as red as mine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;So now, when I try to make something worthwhile, art even, you&#x2019;re up in arms, calling me a vandal?&#x201d; Just tell me how much detention I have so we can all move on with our lives, and I can X-Acto&#x2013;cut Jordyn out of mine. I wonder how long she had to sit here before stabbing me in the back. She&#x2019;s spineless, so she&#x2019;s always asked me to break the rules for her. Which I&#x2019;ve done plenty of times, because I thought we were a team. I bet all Mr. Howard had to do was ask, and she rolled right over like a David Hockney dachshund. The light by Mr. Howard&#x2019;s door flashes, indicating first period is about to begin. All my anger fizzles away and I just feel weak, depleted at the thought of Jordyn heading off to her first class, no worries, all smiles, while I get interrogated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Howard stands up and walks to his office door without saying a word. He opens it and my stomach flips; all my bravado turns bashful as he ushers my mothers into the room. It&#x2019;s one thing to piss off the principal. I can barely look at my parents as he tells them I&#x2019;m expelled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It&#x2019;s silent.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Who am I kidding? It&#x2019;s always silent, but this--I can feel it. Like for the first time, I know what the word really means. It pounds in my head. Silence is the loudest sound. Ma doesn&#x2019;t scowl in the rearview. Mee doesn&#x2019;t sign a word.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I messed up. It was beautiful. Not a masterpiece but, I don&#x2019;t know, close? Didn&#x2019;t matter, got caught. Shouldn&#x2019;t have done it on school property and definitely shouldn&#x2019;t have texted anyone evidence; those were toy mistakes and I knew better. I stood up for Jordyn, tried to save her dignity. She cried and cried the day we discovered it. And when it looked like the school wasn&#x2019;t going to help her, I did. I helped her, and she ratted me out--I just don&#x2019;t understand. I get expelled and Jordyn gets what? Nothing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The expulsion was an overreaction, if you ask me. But that was the &#x201c;final straw&#x201d; and &#x201c;the school won&#x2019;t be responsible&#x201d; for whatever &#x201c;mayhem&#x201d; (really?) I cause next. My first real piece and I&#x2019;m expelled. And now I need a new tag. Go ahead, call me a vandal, say I&#x2019;m some sort of delinquent, it isn&#x2019;t going to insult me. It&#x2019;s not going to stop me. Please. This is what I live for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Silence. I stare at the backs of my parents&#x2019; heads, waiting for one of them to start in on me. Waiting for Mee&#x2019;s pointer finger to fly to her chin with that grimace she saves for special occasions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Disappointed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It never comes, so I kick off my shoes and rush upstairs as soon as we&#x2019;re home. If they&#x2019;re not talking yet, I&#x2019;m not going to be the first. I crash-land onto my bed face-first and grip the quilt in clenched fists. I pound the mattress. What&#x2019;s! Wrong! With! Her?! Who would do something like that? She was the only real friend I had, the only one who knew me and my whole paint-splattered story. It eats at me, worming its way through my stomach and up to my brain. Neither organ can make any sense of it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My phone vibrates in my pocket, and I&#x2019;m hoping Jordyn has a damn good explanation for what she did to me. Because only one person I know would be texting me right now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JORDYN: Srry :(</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JULIA: &#x449;(�&#x414;�&#x449;)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That&#x2019;s it?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JORDYN: They were gonna call the cops. On meeee!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JULIA: &#xffe2;_&#xffe2;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JULIA: No. They weren&#x2019;t.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JORDYN: Mayb.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JULIA: They kicked *me* out!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JORDYN: I didnt think they would really do it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JULIA: WHY</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JORDYN: Idk. I mean u did break the law and stuff.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JULIA: Standing up for you!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JORDYN: U didn&#x2019;t have to. I didnt ask u.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JULIA: Are you kidding me?!?!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JORDYN: It&#x2019;s not like u care abt getting in trouble.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JORDYN: I did u a favor. Ur gonna be famous now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>JORDYN: Don&#x2019;t be so mad.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I stuff my phone under my pillow. I don&#x2019;t care what else she has to say. Nothing can make up for what&#x2019;s already been done. Nothing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I love gray days. Every tree, building, telephone pole highlighted against the gesso-colored sky. This past week has been especially overcast and it&#x2019;s a relief. I thought getting registered at a new school would take at least a month, that I would get to stay out of the educational system for a while. But with both of my moms at the helm, it only took four days. Now, three weeks in at Finley, the spotlight hasn&#x2019;t grown any dimmer. I welcome the clouds. Bring on the fog.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It&#x2019;s getting to be that time of year when it&#x2019;s still dark in the morning and the roads are empty. The drive to Finley is one of the few things I don&#x2019;t hate about the transfer. You would think the forty minutes it takes to commute from Queens Village would suck, but I love driving. Gives me time to think. I drive through the &#x2019;burbs of Greenlawn with the tree-lined sidewalks and traffic lights reflecting in the wet road. The leaves aren&#x2019;t turning yet, but they&#x2019;re about to. I spot a red leaf here and there, pilot lights to the season. Just me and my car, Lee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Good ole Lee. I bought her off of Craigslist this summer for twelve hundred bucks, a 1994 Oldsmobile. She&#x2019;s older than I am, but she&#x2019;s got some moves left. When I got her, she was this horrible maroon color. Now she&#x2019;s perfect: black and white, with flecks of color here and there. Krasner meets Basquiat. That&#x2019;s Lee. She&#x2019;s the only real friend I have left, the only one who&#x2019;s never let me down.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I fish through my bag on the passenger seat, getting my morning ritual started en route. Pull out a can of Red Bull, hold it between my thighs (I&#x2019;m an expert at driving one-handed), and crack it open. I hate coffee. It&#x2019;s either bitter or sour or chalky, not to mention the bad breath. Red Bull isn&#x2019;t the most delicious morning elixir, but a girl&#x2019;s gotta get a jolt from something.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pulling into the parking lot of my new hellscape, I look for a spot up front in case I need to make a quick getaway. I haven&#x2019;t actually tried escaping from school yet, but you never know. Doesn&#x2019;t matter that the overly accommodating administrators reserved a spot for me next to the front doors. I refuse to park there. I can walk. Don&#x2019;t baby me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I don&#x2019;t get the best spot this morning, but it&#x2019;s not a gym day, so I probably won&#x2019;t feel the need to flee. I reach to put Lee into Park when--SLAM!--she lurches forward and my seat belt digs into my chest. I swivel around in my seat and look out the rear window.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Kyle Fucking Stokers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He tried to park in my spot, not noticing that my car was already there. What a tool. He&#x2019;s one of those people who&#x2019;s unaware of anyone or anything else in his vicinity. Bow down to him, the only person on earth who truly matters. So of course this whole ordeal is about to be blamed on me. Doesn&#x2019;t matter that I was already parked, minding my own business. I exist, therefore I am at fault.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I get out, not bothering to put on my shoes. My socks are getting damp as I walk around on the wet pavement. Lee&#x2019;s bumper is okay, no real harm done. Tough bird. Some of my paint job has come away, but the maroon showing through isn&#x2019;t a tragedy. I&#x2019;m the only person who would even notice. Before I can get a closer look, there&#x2019;s hands on my shoulders and Kyle spins me around to face him. He&#x2019;s yelling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;What----------parking here?!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There&#x2019;s always a moment when one of these kids asks me a question and I have to figure out if speaking is worth the risk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I cross my arms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;You--aint--my bum--r!&#x201d; he rages. It&#x2019;s not easy to lip-read when people are yelling at you. Despite what the distorted-face yeller might actually think.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I stare back at Kyle. He probably spent more time on his dusty blond hair this morning than I ever spend on mine. He has great eyebrows, but that&#x2019;s beside the point.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; He gestures to his car again and again, trying to drive his point home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Walking over to his slick silver car, I spit on my sleeve. I should be yelling at him. I should scream and say, &#x201c;You ran into ME, dipshit!&#x201d; Honestly? He&#x2019;s not worth it. I buff off the paint and gesture at the spot. All better. I raise my eyebrows and smile. He doesn&#x2019;t catch the sarcasm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Bitches shouldn&#x2019;t drive,&#x201d; he says slowly, deliberately. I catch every word. He turns and walks toward the school. I imagine throwing my keys at him, chasing him down, kicking his shins until he&#x2019;s on the ground. I slam my fists into his chest over and over and--</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There&#x2019;s a tap on my shoulder and I snap to. Kyle disappears into school through the double doors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;Julia! Where are your shoes?&#x201d; Casey signs. She&#x2019;s looking at me like I&#x2019;m crazy, not a hair out of place in her perfectly cut chin-length bob. Her eyes behind her black-framed glasses are magnified to a ridiculous size, like something out of a Margaret Keane painting. I point over to Lee.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&#x201c;One minute,&#x201d; I reply. &#x201c;See you in history.&#x201d; I shoo her away from me, because the last thing I need is Casey thinking she can solve all my problems outside of class, too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I get back in the car and peel off my socks. Great. Now I&#x2019;m going to end up with blisters. Mee bought me new Doc Martens before the transfer. She winked when she gave them to me--a signal she reserves for when something is to be kept just between us. Ma would kill her if she knew Mee was buying me gifts now. Rightfully so; I know I don&#x2019;t deserve them. But they make me smile. They&#x2019;re yellow, my favorite color. Problem is, they&#x2019;re impossible to break in and twice as impossible to drive in, so I drive in my socks and put the boots on before school. I squeeze my size 10 feet in and lace them up loosely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I reach into the backseat to grab my hoodie, but the one I pull out isn&#x2019;t mine. It&#x2019;s Jordyn&#x2019;s, all purple and pilly. It even smells like her. How long has it been in here? Sand spills out of the folds, and I remember that day on Coney Island when we shared a spicy mango on a stick. Like we always did. Like we never will again. Not any time soon. I shove it under the passenger seat. I can&#x2019;t stand to look at it right now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I need my own hoodie, my trusty black-faded-gray-with-age armor. The sleeves and hem flecked with rainbows of spray paint. This is what I wear when I go out and tag stuff. I yank the zipper up to my chin, and I&#x2019;m protected. The hood falls over my two loose black buns, down over my ears. I take my bag, open my second Red Bull, and drink it, heading toward the big blue building.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>At first I thought transferring to Finley wouldn&#x2019;t be a big deal. School is school; I hated it at Kingston, I&#x2019;d hate it at Finley. I mean, Jordyn is always going out with hearies and they seem fine, but it&#x2019;s not like I&#x2019;m looking to make friends. I don&#x2019;t have time for that shit anymore. Not after Jordyn showed me what she&#x2019;s really made of. No one here would even notice me, right?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Casey took care of that right quick. Having an interpreter in every class is like having a giant neon sign hanging around your neck, blinking: Freak Freak Freak. I&#x2019;ve been here three weeks and people are still confused about how it all works. It&#x2019;s not hard: teacher talks, interpreter signs, I understand. They act like Casey&#x2019;s conjuring black magic, waving her arms around, when really she&#x2019;s only blathering on about tariffs or decimal places.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I toss the empty Red Bull into the recycling bin and head for my locker. Mine is stuck in the freshman hall, even though I&#x2019;m a junior, because it&#x2019;s one of the few left over from the start of the year. I open it up and all of a sudden I feel lighter. I take a certain pride in every tag, and I&#x2019;ve done a good job claiming my space here. I know I shouldn&#x2019;t have tagged the inside of the door, but I couldn&#x2019;t help myself. A new color for every week, my tag, my sign: HERE.</p></p>
